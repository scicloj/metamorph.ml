"Is it a great product or great value? No. Did my girlfriend's parents love it anyway? Yes. It seems like a thoughtful gift since it's specific to the person receiving it. So, if there's a difficult someone on your gift list that's around 50-60 years old and has a sweet tooth, you could do worse than this box of goodies. Just make sure you know how old the recipient is. Don't want to go offending people with your gifts.",4
"Once again this is the only way I can get this salsa in japan. It was shipped fast and ahead of time, munchas thank yous",5
"Sugar, butter and eggs are three staples of almost every kitchen.  Who knew that these three ingredients could combine in such a way to produce Jules Destrooper's wonderful butter crisps?<br /><br />I actually learned about butter crisps from my wife's aunt who makes them each year at Christmas.  She always gives us a lot of them and I always eat way more than I should.  I love these treats and they have become a highlight of Christmas for me.<br /><br />The other day I was walking through a local store and happened upon these Jules Destrooper Butter Crisps and immediately grabbed a box.  While they aren't quite as good as the homemade ones of my wife's aunt, they come in at an extremely close second place.<br /><br />Homemade always beats the store bought brand in my opinion, but Jules Destrooper will now get me through the year until December rolls around.  If you enjoy a lightly sweetened, terribly addictive treat, I highly recommend Jules Destrooper's butter crisps.  They are a great snack any time of year and are the perfect compliment to ice cream, coffee or all by themselves.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",5
"I found this product in the health food section of the local grocery store.  All I can say is thank God I bought the smallest size before ordering a larger quantity.  This is at-best a barely adequate substitute for regular all-purpose flour.  It imparts a strong bean taste to baked goods.  Is that what you're really looking for flavor-wise?  I don't think so.  Sorry,  this  might be good in savory dishes, but as far as desserts or sweet snacks--it's a dud.<br /><br />In terms of texture, I found it to be too grainy.  But in all defense to the product, most GF flours are not really the same thing as regular wheat flour in terms of texture.  That's why virtually all the GF recipes recommend adding xanthan gum.  And on this point--since they all recommend adding the xanthan, why don't they just put it in the flour to begin with?  Or at least include a packet of it in the box (Heaven knows they charge enough for the flour--would a packet of xanthan gum be too much to ask?).<br /><br />I was hoping I had found a solution to the gluten problem of regular wheat flour in this product.  I didn't and am still ISO an adequate substitute.",3
"I bought this for myself because I really enjoy mint flavor, but my wife used more of it than I did (its all gone now, time to order more!).<br /><br /> Very good, very sweet.  Best if added to things that are not already too sweet.<br /><br /> Extremely good in strong hot chocolate.<br /><br /> The syrup pump accessory is very convenient, avoids a sticky cap after many uses.<br /><br />ron",5
Any true peanut butter & chocolate fan will love this product!!! It taste wonderful just on it's own. I couldn't be more happy with my purchase.,5
These potatoes are really very good.  My husband and I both *love* them.  And way too easy.  We will be buying more of these.,5
"I love these granola bars!  I can honestly say they are the best granola bars I've ever eaten.  They also have protein, and I love eating them just as a snack as well as if I'm on the go or post workout.  My only problem is they are hard to find in grocery stores...and I usually don't like to wait around to fill out a ""please stock this item"" form.",5
"This is a GREAT alternative to peanutbutter for those watching fat, carbs or calories.  Comparing 190 calories for 2 TBLS to 15 calories for PB2, is unbelievable.  I've even bought this as a gift for ladies working to slim down before weddings.  My husband can add as much as he cares to his protein shakes and I mix it for an apple dip.  I tastes like peanutbutter, because IT IS.  They have just pressed the fat out.  Definite staple for the shelf.  I would have given it 5 stars, but I like the PBS chocolate powdered peanut butter even better.",4
"Have always enjoyed Balsen products. Found  the nuss-dessert cookies while on vacation at Sanibel Island Florida. We were really excited to find them on Amazon, we had searched through out the Chicago area since last April.<br />They are the best. Taste like fresh hazelnuts and are great with either coffee or tea. (or later with wine).<br />So good that I bought a case, but they are reserved for special moments(like now).",5
"this is a great product,it helps to relieve my bloating.I will order it again.Thank you.its better then anything else i have tryed",4
"I was skeptical about salsa flavored potato chips. I usually pair salsa with corn chips, because of the complimentary taste combination of corn with the salsa ingredients. How would potato chips do with this? Well, I am happy to say that these chips are tangy, they have a bite to them and it is actually a great flavor to try, if you haven't already. They are more savory than spicy.",5
"Unfortunately, this product is in foil packets, NOT K-Cups, although it is listed as such using the Amazon filters for sorting.  It is not a returnable product, but Amazon Customer Service has helped me rectify the situation.  Beware!",1
"Little one loves these and glass is recyclable forever which plastic (Gerber) is not. About the same price, food is healthier and she's more likely to eat this stuff.",4
"I love to take PB and J for lunch at work so I wanted to get a bulk peanut butter.  I like the natural peanut butters, but most have a big layer of oil at the top that you have to stir into the jar and that gets old fast (and messy).  The Skippy natural is much better.  Some jars have no oil on top, others a thin layer that stirs in quickly.  The PB is smooth and spreads easily.  It tastes great, as one would expect with the simple ingredients.<br /><br />If you like the basic natural peanut butter, it doesn't get much better than this.",5
Two of the flavors were "pretty good" - Sugar Cookie and Chocolate Chip.  The other two - Ginger Snap and Macaroon Marvel - had a bad chemical taste that over-whelmed the coffee ... BLECH!,1
"Product arrived promptly.  I love Amazon Prime...Used this sauce in my Indonesian Pork Fried Rice recipe that night and it was the winning ingredient.  No supermarket in my area carried this product and I probably could have gotten it at one of the Asian markets in the city, but ordering it seemed a sure thing.  The bottle is huge;  I will have to will it to my children upon my demise as I will never use it up, hence the 4 star rating.  It really is very good, much sweeter and thicker than regular soy sauce. If a recipe calls for this ingredient, get it and don't substitute soy sauce...the taste and texture is very different.",4
"I usually find ""flavored"" coffee to be cheap, terrible-tasting coffee that's overly-perfumed so you don't suspect how bad it is until you taste it.  Gevalia's Dark Chocolate Truffle didn't fall into this trap--it's a decent, but not great coffee on its own.  It has a little bit too much of a mocha flavor for me, but your mileage may vary.<br /><br />One thing I've found that works great is that I use the Gevalia for 1/3 of my normal grounds allocation, and my normal coffee for the other 2/3.  This yields a cup of coffee that has a nice chocolate taste, but not overwhelmingly so. (To clarify--if I'm using 3 scoops of coffee, I'll use 1 of Gevalia and 2 of my normal coffee).  Of course, I'm also the kind of guy who puts three different types of cereal into the same bowl at once, which I realize isn't for everyone. This coffee certainly isn't one I'd drink every day (and I drink a number of cups of coffee each day), but it is nice on occasion.<br /><br />In short, if you're looking for a chocolate-flavored coffee, you could do worse than this one.",3
"What a treat! This oatmeal is fantastic and also a healthy option for breakfast. My entire family loves it. Keep in mind it takes time to prepare, but don't all things good take a little extra TLC?",4
"Great product! The popcorn is low in calories (100) and a delicious snack. The aroma alone is worth the price.<br />I pop a bag every morning and take it to work for a snack at mid-day. Buying in bulk from Amazon is great--the packages arrive quickly and I don't have to think about it for quite a while, until the supply runs low. Then I just order again.",5
I received the coffee on time as promised.  Paul Newman's coffee is fantastic! It has a very rich and robust flavor. I will buy it from now on!,5
"came on time in a resealable bag marked with product description, perfect, tastes just like buttery popcorn.  My kids love it thanks",5

"I'm very surprised no one has written about these, yet.  I never really thought much of dry roast almonds; they're either over-roasted, or they're correctly roasted, but Maisie Jane's almonds are the smoothest I've ever had.  I'm a typical buyer of Trader Joe's brand almonds, but three pounds of TJ's costs around 21 bucks, so this is a better deal.  However, the difference in taste and crunch makes Maisie Jane's a far better value.  This is my brand, now.  Hands down.",5
"This stuff taste the worse, no sweetner helps and it stinks up the place...Stay away from this stuff, what a waste of money.",1
"While I was in a coma I ate these for desert.  They are very good tasting, don't have any ""Sugary muck"" taste, just plain, but really filling and don't give me gas.<br /><br />I like them with iced tea or pelican juice.<br /><br />Since there's no Sugar in them you can leave them out in the sun without getting a diabetic seizure.  Ants don't like them for some reason.",5
"Mad dog inferno is one of the rare hot sauces that combines burn your tongue off hot with a nice flavor to boot.  The hot sauce's flavor resembles a worchestershire sauce type of taste with an extremely hot kick that doesn't dissipate for a solid five minutes or so.  Use this sauce very sparingly by itself, and I recommend using it as a way to kick up flavors and or spiciness in dips, stews, chilis or anything else your looking to put an exclamation point on.  As an avid cook and hot sauce aficionado, I highly recommend this hot sauce.",5
I thought the coffee tasted fine.  It was not strong enough for my husband.  Several of the pods burst during brewing.  I probably won't purchase this again.,3

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea.

This is one of the better K-Cups for someone who enjoys a bold cup of coffee.,5

"If you're like me - you're reading the reviews on all the maple syrups available on amazon...this and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00271OPVU"">Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug</a> come up as the most favorably reviewed.<br /><br />I couldn't make up my mind so I ordered both.  Coombs is the winner for us.  Brown Family's was good - but Coombs had a bit stronger of a maple flavor.  Taste is definitely personal - but comparing them side by side with the same pancakes - Coombs had more flavor and next to it, Brown Family didn't seem flavorful at all.  This is still better than all the 'fake' syrups though!  We will finish the bottle, but will be reordering Coombs.",3
"I hate making black icing at home, there's always an after taste from the food coloring and it ends up being a big mess. The Wilton tubes of black icing are great for frozen buttercream transfers when I decorate a birthday cake and much easier to handle.",5

"I had never had matcha before and wanted to try it for the adults in the family who want a good supply of energy and antioxidants, too.  I used this to make a mocha matcha latte, adding it to my morning glass of chocolate skim milk, and it tastes like a pricey coffee shop drink!  I can't wait until my daughter comes home so she can try it, I know she will be hooked.",5

"I'm not surprised that my first Amazon review revolves around coffee.<br /><br />I was spending way too much money on chain brand pumpkin spice lattes, so I decided to give this product a try. I received it yesterday, and 4 cups of coffee later I think I'm hooked. Personally, I like that it's not too sweet so I can control how sweet I want it with extra sugar/sweetener. I think, in terms of flavor intensity, 1 pump goes well with 8-10oz of coffee. Add in 1-2 packs of sweetener and it has a very similar taste to coffee shop pumpkin spice.<br /><br />I was torn between this flavor and pumpkin spice, so I'm curious as to the flavor difference between the two. I might get the holiday syrup pack, and if I do, I'll update my review with a comparison.",5
My daughter likes this but prefers the chunkier texture of the EB chicken & stars. This was good when she didn't have teeth and wasn't a good chewer like she is now.,4
"Packaging is easy to open and the aroma of the grounds makes one excited about brewing a pot. Smooth and very little bitterness, this is a very nice flavored coffee. Usually I drink <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002TN49F8"">Melitta Cafe Collection Parisian Vanilla Ground Coffee, 11-Ounce Bags (Pack of 3)</a> but if I ran out I would be more than happy to serve this to myself and any guests. Makes a great stocking stuffer at Xmas for the coffee lover as well.",4
"These are excellent quality dried mushrooms. They rehydrate in hot water (no need to use boiling hot water) in no time at all. Being dried, they of course are not the same taste or texture as fresh oyster mushrooms, but they are great - just different. Just like a dried fruit isn't the same as a fresh one, just different. I found no dirt, pebbles or sticks in them. Some of the other mushrooms from this vendor have rocks and twigs in them - not these.",5
"My dentist recommended Spry, so I thought I'd give it a chance. It's pricier than most of the sugarfree gums I frequent, but it came recommended by an oral expert, so I figured it would be worth a try.<br /><br />NOT WORTH IT.<br /><br />Literally, after less than 4 minutes, the flavor is completely gone, and the gum itself reverts to a stale, slightly metallic, tough-to-chew state of existence. I'm not sure how much teeth cleaning the Xylitol in the gum itself is doing because it seems to lose flavor so fast. Correct me if I'm wrong, but xylitol is a sweetener, so if the sweetness of the gum is lost after a good (or bad?) 3 minutes, then there really wasn't that much Xylitol to begin with?<br /><br />Also, further research showed that you actually need more xylitol than the amount in the gum itself before it proves to be beneficial.<br /><br />Given how much xylitol is in the Spry gum, it's neither good nor bad to be chewing Spry, and what tips that balance towards ""No Thanks"" is the fact that it is not worth its value.<br /><br />Also (this is USEFUL), I've tried the Spearmint, Citrus & Green Tea, and out of the three, the Green Tea tastes the weirdest. It's almost matcha-like in flavor, but there's something off, like it's almost like someone took the descriptions of what Green Tea tasted like without actually ever tasting it, and then tried to re-create the flavor in the gum. It's very artificial tasting, with the barest of hints of Green Tea.<br /><br />This is USEFUL information for those who want to chew gum to freshen their breath, or prolong the feeling of minty goodness in their mouth for more than just a couple of minutes!",2
I fancy myself as a bit of a curry snob.  Nothing out of a package has ever come close to meeting my expectations.  This was absolutely amazing.  I challenge you to find anything better in the finest Indian restaurants.,5
ALBA HAS BEEN A GREAT PRODUCT FOR ME AND I'M SURE IT'S GOOD FOR ALL SKIN TYPES AS IT IS BASICALLY AN ALL NATURAL PRODUCT. THE MASK IS GREAT FEELS COOL AND SOOTHING A LITTLE GOES A LONG WAY BUT I'VE ONLY USED IT 2 TIMES SO I CAN'T TELL YOU I LOOK 21 AGAIN.  AT LEAST NOT YET. I RECOMMEND ALL ALBA PRODUCTS. GOOD PRICE AT THIS SITE.,5
"The multi-pack of Snickers found here on Amazon is a good price and of course the taste is great.  I bought this product from Amazon mainly for the bargain. I gave it 5 stars because compared to the price at the local dollar store that average $3 per bag, so 6 bags would equal to $18, here on Amazon, it is 6 bags for only $12; so I saved an average $6 by purchasing from Amazon.  The snickers were fresh, not out-of-date, and I received order in a timely matter.  Very pleased and will order again.",5
"I have my mother's cat now.  He isn't allowed outside.  He threw up on what seemed to be the majority of surfaces in her house, and was proceeding to leave what seems to be indelible marks on my floors, and rugs, and furniture.<br />This cat food has stopped that.<br />Despite having the old cat food, Purina One, still in his dish, he ate this anti-hairball cat food so fast when I opened the bag and put it into his dish, that I was sure I would have him throwing it up all over the place.  Didn't happen.<br />Things were better within 2 days, and he has now stopped any of the choking, throwing up, etc.  I haven't found any, seen any, or heard anything.<br />It's been a couple of weks now, and he still seems to love the food, and my life is much better.<br />I think it is well worth the price, and I am very glad I took the chance.",5
"With six cats in the house, let me say I was THRILLED that Amazon.com offered this in their vine program. My cats eat anything that doesn't run away from them, but everyone from the year old cat, to the seventeen year old diabetic kitty LOVED this food. Even my mom's cat, who is known to be pretty finicky loved it.<br /><br />The food looks like ""real"" food, not the loaf-type food so often seen in canned cat food, and it smells great. Not stinky at all. The cats gobbled it right up, and I like that there is plenty of broth and liquid on the food, because that helps my eldest cat, who is missing several teeth, eat it just fine.<br /><br />I've been feeding wellness and Eagle Pack Holistic food in addition to prescription food. This ranks right alongside those expensive foods. Good stuff!!!!",5
Black beans are pretty versatile; they can be used hot or cold in various dishes. These beans are firm not squishy nor<br />overpoweringly flavored. For less than 15 bucks a 12 pack they're a decent deal. I didn't give them 5 stars due to the discrepancy between posted and actual nutritional details.<br /><br />This information is very important to some customers. To reduce the salt somewhat be sure to rinse the beans in cold water and drain them. This also helps cut heartburn...sorry I don't have any suggestions for reducing the "tooters" though.,4
"Excellent flavor, quick dissolving.  No after taste.  I like being able to make this tea as strong as I want.  Can't be found in any grocery stores any more in my area.  Diet raspberry is also excellent.",5
"I am so happy to have these cupcakes!  They are moist, delicious, not too sweet and are perfect when paired with Pamela's chocolate frosting.  Actually, I often have requests to bring them to parties.  I agree that you do have to cook them longer than indicated on the package, but it's well worth it.<br /><br />For my daughter's birthday parties I make these, with Pamela's frosting (I don't like Pamela's cakes) and I get an all ice cream cake from Baskin Robins.  That way she gets her cupcakes but she also gets a cake that looks like all of the cakes she sees at other birthdays, too!",5
"I like these products a lot, but feel that this flavor is a little too smoky for my taste. I love, love and love the Sea Salt version. Great way to mix in some fiber into the diet during those snack times!",4
"I drink Twinings Orange Pekoe black tea, raspberry leaf tea and this. I can't stand any other teas very much.<br /><br />This is especially wonderful with a greek or middle eastern dinner.",5
"This coffee bean doesn't taste anything like the one i've tried in starbuck and at some oher candy store. It has a somewhat rusty or metallic taste that i can't figure out. Also the product arrived partially damaged i guess from the extreme heat, i just don't know if it has something to do with the overall prouct taste?",1
"I just had a baby and thought this would be a great soup to try in my first week postpartum. I was right, not only was it easy to toss into my slow cooker, but it gave me the comfort food I was really looking for after a lackluster hospital experience! I savored every tasty drop.",5
"While this is packaged well and convenient to open and pour out, it doesn't matter how easy it is<br />or how healthy if you can't get the baby to eat it! This is extremely blah, bland mush. I certainly<br />expected much better from this brand. In addition, since it's a stage 3 food, I expected there to be<br />pieces of meat and vegetables, however there's just a bunch of lightish brown mush my baby wont eat<br />even why I try to force it down her. Definitely wouldn't recommend to anyone despite it's health rating.",2
I don't understand why Pamela's has to over compensate by using so much sweetener in their bread mix.  If I wanted a sweet bread I would add my own sugar!  This is not a bread to have eggs and ham with.  It taste more like a dessert.  There are better brands of gluten free bread mix out there. Don't waste your money on this one.,2
"Love it! My favorite usage of this wonderful product is to add it to my morning porridge. For example, try semolina/yellow corn grits/cocoa butter chips or semolina/barley/cocoa butter chips. Of course you add the chips when the porridge is ready, you don't cook them. Enjoy!",5
During the time I lived in England I became aware of this product and was pleasantly surprised when I found it on Amazon. I continue to purchase and consume Ribena when a fresh light refreshing drink is needed after a hard day at the office.,5
"We enjoy this coffee very much.  With subscribe and save, it is a great value as well.  The hazelnut flavor is strong which is a plus for us, but might be overwhelming for some.  Only wish the coffee itself was a bit more bold.",4
I have used this for years to make my meatloaf. The whole family loves it. I have not been able to find it in the local grocery store for about a year. I was happy when I found it on Amazon.,5
"i rarely eat chips but i saw these and tried them. they are really amazing. i love cheddar too, but the chips are really thin and crunch and delicious flavor. i recommend them.",5
"Whether breakfast on a Saturday morning or even as a late night snack, what hits the spot better than a big bowl of cereal?  With dozens of varieties lining the wall of any given grocery aisle, the real question here is whether Kellog's Crunchy Nut is better than the competition and worth the price.<br /><br />Combining the shape and texture of Cheerios with the flavor of a much sweeter treat, the Roasted Nut and Honey cereal is a winner for anyone who likes an intense honey taste and a strong crunch.  Soggy cereal - the bane of any breakfast - isn't an issue here, as it stays firm and crunchy for more than enough time to finish off a full bowl.  The edges of each piece are a little sharp, but they don't shred the mouth like Peanut Butter Crunch or similar breakfast cereals.<br /><br />For the cereal lover with a sweet tooth who doesn't want their breakfast to get soggy, Crunchy Nut Roasted Nut and Honey is a great choice and well worth trying out.",4
I totally love POPCHIPS - but the Sea Salt and Vinegar just has too much Vinegar taste for me.  I felt like I was eating just vinegar.  I took the rest to work and some people like the flavor and some said just to much vinegar for them.,2
"I read an interview in Inc magazine about the founder of the company, and it inspired me to try a bar at Starbucks, where they are selling them at the cash register these days. I loved it. The one I sampled was different from this product, but this one sounded like I would enjoy it even more, and I did.<br /><br />These bars are not particularly low calorie, though, in the article I mention above, the founder says he sometimes eats two of them for lunch.  That's about right, it would be a tasty light on-the-go lunch at 420 calories.  So much better for you than a candy bar.",5
"after the first few treats come out, no more will come out. even I can't get them out!!<br />I have bought buster cubes in the past that have worked fine. I expect the dogs to work a reasonable amount to get the treats out. that is the point. but this is impossible. are there different brands?",1
"Penzey's stopped making jalapeno powder, so I found this brand.  I highly recommend this powder as it has very good heat level; provided you don't mind extra work.<br /><br />They put rice, thoroughly intermixed with powder from top to bottom to prevent caking, which I appreciate.  The shaker lid has holes too large in diameter, allowing the rice to fall out.  Thus, you must use a small mesh strainer to separate the rice and powder; which I strongly dislike.<br /><br />I thought the rice might not be long grain, so I tested the lid with long grain rice.  The holes need to be reduced to half original diameter to prevent the rice from falling out.  If they fixed this obvious design error, 5 star.",3
"My 7 month old loves this flavor. He's just started really feeding himself last month and I've tried some other brands. Most were too firm to properly ""melt"" without chewing. I know, because I personally tried them before giving them to him. I looked over the ingredients before purchase. (Apparently, some of the other reviewers on here did not. Their problem, not yours/ours.) It says in red letters on the container for this flavor, just below the ingredient list: ""Contains wheat. No dairy. No corn. No soy."" It also says that of the flavors, only Strawberry and Sweet Potato are gluten free. If you're concerned about ingredients in the foods you give your child, it's probably a good idea to read the ingredients first.<br /><br />The initial taste is a touch sweet, followed by a mild toasted flavor. Kix is the same way, only many times more intense. I like that if you just put them in your mouth and provide moisture and pressure they dissolve easily. I also like that they have the choline, and are sweetened with juice not sugar. Even if my son hated these, I'd probably snack on them myself. LOL.<br /><br />There you go. Bottom line, we both like them and hope to try the other flavors as well.",5
Midnight loves gravy and this is about the only product that has near enough to satisfy her. Therefore I am happy as long as it continues to have a lot of gravy.,5
"I purchased a box of 12 packages (the only amount offered) of Miltons Baking Company Whole Wheat Sesame crackers on Amazon because i was desperate to find a reliable source.  I love these crackers!  As a whole wheat cracker, Milton's are the very best...crispy, flavorful and delicious!  However, when i received my crackers from the distributor(not Miltons) they had a mere 30 days left on the pull date.  It's hard to chug-a-lug twelve packages in 30 days! They were already stale and oddly chipped as if mice had been nibbling along the edges. Yuck! When i contacted the distributor, they refused entirely to back the product and left me hanging with a costly mistake, useless crackers, and a very bad taste in my mouth for Miltons and them.  Frustrated, i contacted Miltons Baking Company directly.  What a pleasure!  They let me know that the ""mice nibbles"" were from pins holding the crackers during packaging and were below their acceptable product standard. And, in a really generous gesture, they let me know immediately that, although the crackers were beyond the pull date, they would be happy to replace them under the circumstances!  Every aspect of my experience with the Milton Baking Company was amazingly warm and responsive -- and quick.  I'm looking forward to my deeeelicious crackers.  They are the best!  And i am very grateful for a company that really stands behind their product guarantee of full satisfaction.  Yes!  Thanks, Miltons!",5

"Our Saint Bernard is 4 yrs. old and has always turned his nose up to rawhide or similar type chews.  Trying to brush his teeth is always a challenge.  A woman at the vets office (who had the same issues with her dogs), told me her dogs really enjoy these HEXtra chews.  She was absolutely right, they're great.  Our Saint loves 'em!  Not only do they keep him busy for awhile, but they actually do help keep his teeth clean . . . without fighting to brush them!  Whatever taste they have, it sure gets his attention.  An excellent product for maintaining your dogs oral hygiene.",5
"I received a package of the Udi's Gluten Free Snickerdoodles just before Christmas. I have not had any gluten free  or even regular snickerdoodles in over 6 years. These are by far the very best snickerdoodles I've ever had both with and without gluten! They are soft, just the right thickness for a nice chewy bite, and the perfect amount of cinnamon.  I shared them with other family members who are not gluten free and they were very surprised to find that they were gluten free and the best ever! If you haven't tried them, they are a must!",5
"In the 1980s I spent several summers in Italy. This biscotti is often given as a breakfast food or mid-day snack. They are simple and delicious and were not sold in the US back then. They are so good that I brought back two bags from a recent trip to Italy. It is great to see that they may now be found on Amazon!<br /><br />Note: it is great to open a bag, smell the contents, pour a glass of milk, then dip the Macines in the milk. Great routine and treat for kids!",5

"Just got the Ekobrew today and tried it out. I have been a Solofill fan since they came out but the Ekobrew design seems to beat the Solofill. First off, the flat bottom makes it easy to fill. I usually run two cycles for a larger cup of coffee. With the Ekobrew the lid stays shut and doesn't leak water at the top. I was surprised how easily the grounds came out and just a quick rinse and it was ready to go again. Seems to be the best choice around for avoiding the high cost of K cups.",5
"Please pay close attention to the fact that these are only 2 ounces. That is very tiny - one gulp and you are done. The flavor is OK. The product description claims that ""When you are feeling run down, lethargic, or just can't seem to concentrate, bring on the Rain! Red Rain Energy Shots!"" I would argue that this is a bit of an over-statement. My guess is that the placebo effect of drinking a mysterious liquid from a tiny red bottle is more invigorating than the actual effect of the ingredients on your system.",3
"I've had frequent headaches, muscle cramps, and headaches since I was a child.  I have vivid memories of laying awake into the late hours of the night before exhaustion and sleep would settle in.  When I reached high school, the stress transformed the frequent headaches into occasional migraines.  I treated them for a while with prescription medicine but eventually decided I'd rather live with the pains and adjust in the necessary ways than continue taking medication.  About a year ago, I read an article about Natural CALM and figured `What the heck.'  I was highly doubtful.  I've never been so glad to be wrong.<br /><br />I buy the raspberry-lemon flavor.  To me, it tastes like a bit of raspberry lemonade Crystal Light mixed with an Alka-Seltzer.  I certainly wouldn't drink it just because I'm thirsty, but I can tolerate a 12 oz. glass of it in the evening.  In the beginning, I didn't feel much of a difference.  However, once I started taking about 1 teaspoon - which you have to work up to - I noticed a difference in my quality of sleep.  I kept slowly raising the amount and now use about 2 teaspoons nightly.  I don't find that the CALM makes me fall asleep earlier/faster, but I have found that I don't constantly wake up like I did before.  The nighttime leg cramps have almost completely gone.  And the headaches - the constant pounding and throbbing and aching in my head has diminished to just the occasional headache.  As an added benefit, I seem to deal with stress (especially work stress) much better than I did before.  I tried something else to help with sleep (see below) and, after I stopped taking that, I didn't start taking the CALM again for a little while to see if I could actually tell a difference in the way I felt, slept, and reacted to events.  I did - and so did some others around me!  From now on, I don't plan to go without it.<br /><br />I love this stuff and I turn as many people onto it as I can.  A friend purchased some CALM (the regular flavor:  it worked but tasted pretty bad and made the nightly dose challenging to keep up with) and decided to try <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000N23AE8"">SERIPHOS - 100 - Capsule</a> when she ran out of CALM.  While I was visiting, she gave me some to try.  We both found that it gave us the oddest nightmares and made us very groggy/tired in the morning.  My mother, at her doctor's recommendation, started taking a small dose of melatonin to help her get to sleep and stay asleep through the entire night (she'd often get up about 3 AM and couldn't get back to sleep).  Several times after she started taking it, I called her and she slurred her words as if she were taking some sort of narcotic and she wouldn't remember that she'd even spoken to me on the phone.  I sent her a bottle of the orange flavor (she said it tastes ok - like a Sunny D Alka-Seltzer) and she actually adds it to her morning and bedtime cups of decaf orange tea instead of using the melatonin.  She's sleeping like a champ now.<br /><br />If you're considering the purchase, do it!  Like everything, it may not work for everyone, but it's worth a try if you're even thinking about it.",5
tea has excellent flavor. it is a little expensive but very convenient and great when you don't want to wait for the kettle.,5
"These are so delicious, I had to buy lots of them.  Regular BBQ sunflower seeds are just coated in stuff and the flavor disappears after they've been in your mouth for 2 seconds.

"Like most of us I bought these for a snack. Great for emergency snack to at 160 calories for 2 bars(2bars in one envelope).<br /><br />These bars taste great as most of the reviews agree.<br /><br />The APPLE CRISP is my favorite flavor!<br /><br />GREAT VALUE: 6 Boxes for $16.5 with subscribe and save. Each box has 6 packets with 2 bars. So, 6 boxes of 6 packets per box = 36 packets = 46 cents per pack of 2 bars. Delivered to your door!<br /><br />Basic Nutrition (1 packet of 2 bars): Total fat 6 of 42 grams. Zero cholesterol. 11 of 42grams are sugar. 140mg sodium. Protein 3 of 42grams. Dietary fiber 2 of 42grams. Protein 4 of 42grams. These won't hurt you and they do not replace a good well balanced meal.<br /><br />Crunchy: These can be messy to eat. When you take a bar out of the packets, crumbs fall out. I solved this by pulling both bars out of the packet over a sink or trash can. Shake loose all the crumbs then put them back in the packet. Problem solved.<br /><br />For those that think these are too crunchy. Try: break off a piece and leave it in your mouth less than one minute then chew. I do this and it works great!<br /><br />I also have the chocolate and they are very good, but this is my favorite<br /><br />Enjoy, I do.",5

"This mix is delicious!  Works well with German chocolate/coconut frosting, cream cheese frosting or almost any frosting that isn't citrus flavored.  Rich flavor and nice find here on Amazon--it isn't carried in stores all the time.  I also recommend the Betty Crocker strawberry and cherry mixes, which are hard to find and are available here.",5

My kids love this and so do I.  The brand is consistent. I don't care for the larger containers as it makes getting to the bottom a bit more difficult but when the price is right I like picking it up this way particularly if Peanut Butter prices go up as much as they say it will.  I make five to six sandwiches a day and I use a lot of peanut butter.  This has always done well for me.,4

I wasn't even aware raspberry was sold, but the packaging images and SKU is different from Berry.  Although Amazon has refunded my money and assured me I can order again, I'm concerned the same thing is going to happen.  The Amazon sticker applied to the packaging says ""Berry"" even though it's not.  They've got some serious product confusion here, and need to fix the page to reflect that.",1
Starbucks vanilla is a great coffee.  I'm a fan of Canada's Tim Horton's coffee but it doesn't come in flavors.  Starbucks is also an excellent full bodied coffee and the vanilla flavor is a nice change from regular coffee.,5
"To me, nothing beats homemade hot chocolate created with milk, a molinillo (for example <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001AVREHK"">Vasconia Molinillo</a>) and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001U5GWWY"">Callebaut Extra Bitter (70%) - 11lb Block [Item: 7030</a>] chocolate in a clay pot on the stove.  However, this hot chocolate is very good compared to the powdered packaged hot chocolates I mixed with water in the past.  A 16 count package really only creates eight 6oz hot chocolates because there are two DISCs; one for the milk and the other for the syrup. My only complaint is that the 6 oz. serving size is too small for the price.",4
Love Anna's cookies but ordered this many did not work. The last six boxes even though they had previously been unopen began to loose the lemon flavor and the last four boxes the cookies became limp. Will still continue to buy Anna's cookes but not a dozen at a time.,2
"I bought the coffee maker for my mother for Xmas and it came with many different K cups.  By far, she prefers Newman's Own coffees.  Now, my Mom used to live and breathe coffee and to me, her coffee resembled mud - it was so strong.  She has mellowed in the ensuing years but still prefers a bold (strong) flavor and after trying numerous other brands (Timothy's, Green Mountain, etc) the standout is Newman's.  Recommend for coffee drinkers who like strong/bold flavor.",5

I love the unsweetened soy nut butter by I.M. Healthy. After eating some sweetened soy nut butter I wasn't sure I was going to like it but now I actually like it better.  It tastes very nutty instead of sickeningly sweet.  I love the chunky too!  The only thing I don't like is that amazon sells 6 of them for $29.99 PLUS $13.99 shipping when one of them cost me only $4.99 at Whole Foods!  Let's see- if I buy it at whole foods that's a savings of $13.99 in shipping costs!  I think i'll continue to buy it at Whole Foods until Amazon brings its price down.  The products is really good though.,5
This is such a good tasting syrup that when they stop selling it in the NC stores. I seek amazon and is very impressed with the price.,5
I've used it for brownies (recipe on back) and it's wonderful.  Plus it makes a great coating for grilling seafood.  I also add it to cereal to slow the carbs down and used it in meatloaf instead of grains.  You'll want to get the cookbook.  Very pleased.,5
"My dog likes these.  I use a variety of treats.  Some are smelly salmon or liver.  Dogs like that, you know.  But they also like these.  They really do smell yummy so if you're trying to wean yourself off of feeding your dog people food, these would be a great start.  I am always happy to find a dog treat that has good ingredients and is made in USA.",5
"These are really delicious cookies and they are far healthier than most of the junk in the stores.  They are full of all natural ingredients, no high fructose or additives here.  I gave a couple of bags to my uncle who was eating one of the name brand chocolate chip cookies (ahoy matey) and he's switching brands.  I haven't tried any of the other flavors but as an adult who loves chocolate I can tell you that these are very yummy.",5
"Everyone that comes to my house, I have these out for a snack and everyone loves them. These are amazing pretzels and taste so good. We love to eat them with goat cheese and other cheese's too.",5
"Overall, this product is a great idea. Portable, doesn't need to be refrigerated, low calorie, gluten free. However...this is the worst tasting hummus I have ever had in my entire life. The chocolate was crushed and resembled taffy. The trail mix is good, as are the crackers, especially considering they're gluten free. I purchased this six pack for around $18. At the current price ($29), I don't think I would purchase these at around $5 a piece - just get together some gluten free snacks and put them together in your own lunch kit.",3
"When I want a clean,crisp,fullbodied tea - this is the one.No bitter after taste. Only complaint is that,although I like the pyramid tea bag shape - maybe 1 bag in a box is defective and tea comes out while brewing. Otherwise-it's the best tasting English Breakfast I've tried.",5
"My baby has the milk protein allergy and also seems allergic to soy. I am exclusivley breastfeding, so once I cut dairy and soy out, he was a very happy non-gassy baby who slept better at night. It was time to start rice cereal...I started a little before his 6 month birthday and I found this brand because of all the reviews. I neededsomething that would not upset his tummy. We tried it for a few nights. My baby loved it...he took down every bite with a spoon. Unfortunately, though,he was up all night every night with gas. He also stopped having bowel movements for several days...before we started the cereal it was every day. I went online to ask if rice cereal could cause constipation/gas and I was alarmed by all the moms who had the same experience. I was hoping the happybellies cereal would prevent this, but it didn't. I have 6 cans of it since I couldn't buy one alone, so I'm not sure what to do with them. I went straight into giving him homemade baby food and both baby and his tummy love it...we started with avocado, then banana, squash, and now sweet potatoes. I know he still needs cereal, so I'm thinking about trying the oatmeal. I was so disappointed this cereal didn't work for him.",3
"""Kraft Velveeta Chicken and Broccoli Skillets Dinner Kit"" is OK for a quick meal for those people that aren't picky about what they eat. Think of it as ""Hamburger Helper"", except made for chicken. It actually taste pretty good, but forget about seeing any actual broccoli on your plate. What they call broccoli looks more like specks of parsley, or as others have described it ""broccoli dust"". The box claims to feed 5 people. Forget it. If you eat an average sized portion, it will feed 3. Used as a side dish, perhaps it will feed 4. I enjoyed it, but wouldn't want to eat it regularly. For a quick meal in a pinch though, it's pretty good.",4

Thought this would be the way to go-not only save money on lunches, but to keep it a long time without spoilage. I couldn't wait to get my peanut butter-had the jelly and bread just a-waitin', but low and behold, when I tried to spread it on the bread-yuck-wouldn't even adhere to the knife out of the jar! Next, I tried shaking it from the jar onto the bread, but when I picked the bread up, it fell clean off. Someone suggested I put the jelly on first, but when I did that then stuck the knife into the jar, all I ended up with was a messy knife-still wouldn't spread.<br /><br />I finally gave up and just opened my mouth, put my head back and dumped the stuff directly onto my awaiting tastebuds. On the second attempt, I somehow bypassed the tastebuds and it went directly into my throat where it strangled me.<br /><br />I'd tell this story verbally, but I am now unable to speak because it ate out my vocal cords.<br /><br />So much for convenience.",1
"WOW I've got to say I am a big fan of the Starbucks Via line now. I've seen it before and always fluffed it off as being a unnecessary waste of money. I mean, instant coffee isn't exactly known for bold taste, which I prefer. I'm  a ""coffee snob"" who needs a black or bold roast cup of cofeee every morning or I'll be intolerable. My favorite from Starbucks has always been french roast (smoky and strong). After hearing a friend rave about these, I decided to purchase them given how similar our tastes are. I tried both the Italian and French Roast Via in small packs (from target and starbuck stores). Unlike other instant coffee, it doe not include any creamer or sugar. It's just plain black coffee. Each serving pack is so small but it makes a very strong cup with the same quality taste as you would get from Starbucks itself (and so much cheaper too). Alot of people buy this because it's packaging is very convenient for daily use (throw it in your wallet/purse), as well as for travel (I hate hotel/airplane coffee). All you need is hot water, it doesn't even have to be boiling temperature. So fast, so easy. Great for making ice coffee, coffee desserts, frapuchinos, or just your plain cup of joe. Try it!",5
"Easily the best dry roasted peanuts out there - and you can't beat the price.  I have ordered these several times and have not had any problems with the packaging,",5
"I cannot stress enough what a picky eater my cat is. Just to get her to eat more than a quarter of a 5.5 oz can of food at a time is quite the ordeal. For some time, I had to mix Nutri-cal with her food, because she is tiny for her age and isn't gaining weight at the rate she should be (she is a kitten). I was just about to settle with Earthborn Holistic canned chicken, as she seemed to like it more than any other food I had tried feeding her. It also appeared and smelled far less disgusting to me than the mush that comes in most cans; the consistency of the Earthborn is chicken shreds in gravy, which my cat seems to prefer. But as I was browsing in the cat food section today, I noticed Weruva Paw-lickin Chicken and picked it up to try because according to the description, it seemed that it would have the same consistency as Earthborn. It's also Grain-free and has no veggies (only this flavor is veggie free though) like Earthborn. And it costs the same, so I figured it wouldn't be difficult financially to switch over to Weruva, if she happens to like it.<br /><br />When I opened the can of Weruva today, I immediately noticed that the quality of this food is even better than Earthborn. The formula is almost soupy, with thinner shreds, which are easier for my kitten to chew and swallow. The smell is VERY tolerable and it actually looks like food a human would eat. The BEST part however is that she ate almost ALL of the 3 oz can. I was so shocked to see that once she was done eating what I spooned into her bowl, she went over the open can and began eating.<br /><br />I was a bit concerned initially when I noticed that even though the food is not described as adult food, in the back in small print it says it is for adult nutrition. However, according to Weruva's website, it is fine to feed it to kittens. The only difference between adult food and kitten food apparently, is that kitten food is supposed to contain more protein, because they need more for their growing bodies. But if fed a sufficient amount, this food, especially because it is very protein rich to begin with, provides complete nutrition for kittens as well. Seeing how much she ate confirms that.<br /><br />My only concern with this food, which is any person's concern with any premium quality food is the price. These foods ARE pricey and it can be difficult to justify spending so much on cat food, but if you can afford it, the benefits of premium quality foods (those that are byproduct and grain free, and preferably veggie free) are:<br /><br />-Their poop becomes significantly less stinky. The difference is very noticeable.<br />-The food itself doesn't smell so bad. And this really depends on what type of meat and consistency you buy as well. If you buy a chicken or turkey flavor food, it will be less smelly than a fish food. I don't see the point in feeding your cat fish other than as an occassional treat if she likes it, because it contains some levels of mercury and is not as nutritious to begin with. I've noticed that the mushy formula food smells considerably worse than the gravy foods. Also, I understand that cat foods are smelly because cats will only eat food that has a very strong smell, but that being said, there's a difference between a stench that permeates your room and a smell that remains concentrated in the general area where the food itself is.<br />-You end up saving money on vet bills, because these foods provide superior nutrition and a healthy animal is less likely to be a sickly animal.",5
My Golden Retriever loves these treats. He knows where I keep them and sits by the closet waiting for me to give them to him.,5

"I am a big fan of Thai and Indian curries, and even like that curious yellowy-brown curry that can be found at some Japanese restaurants.  Therefore, my eyes lit up when I spied this curry sauce mix on the list of items that I could obtain free through the Amazon Vine program.  ""Ah!"" I thought. ""A new taste adventure.""<br /><br />Sadly, it was not to be so. This sauce is strongly fragrant of kaffir lime leaves and coconut.  The lime turned out to be the dominant flavor.  While I do like kaffir lime, I have come to expect a complexity of flavors in a good curry sauce, and that's where this mix fell short. I was waiting for that ""Ahhh...curry....mmmmm..."" moment, but it didn't come.  The flavor was oddly pedestrian, almost (but not quite) flat.  While it was a satisfactory dinner for me on an ordinary night, it's certainly not one that I will put on my short list to serve to guests.  Or even my long list, for that matter.<br /><br />To be fair, sometimes dishes with a blend of spices require a bit of time for the flavors to come out.  I let it sit overnight in the refrigerator, reheated it, tasted it with hope in my heart, but detected little appreciable change in the flavor.<br /><br />The recipe called for beef tenderloin, but I used regular old stew meat, and it came out fine.<br /><br />Singles, take note:  Although it yields less than the 15 servings promised by the nutritional label, the recipe makes a generous amount of sauce. It calls for 28 oz of beef, so be prepared for leftovers.  Dividing the contents of the envelopes in half would probably be messy.<br /><br />Amazon does carry some very good curry mixes.  I highly recommend <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V17MLS"">Kitchens of India Paste for Butter Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a> and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000V1D19A"">Kitchens Of India Curry Paste For Chicken Curry, 3.5-Ounce Boxes (Pack of 6)</a>.  Both of these pastes are on the greasy side (I skim the grease off the top before serving), but dang are they good!",3

"When I first received the bag and opened it, I was in heaven. The smell of this coffee is amazing. However, the taste doesn't measure up to the smell.<br /><br />Some background: I love strong coffee and can't stand the thought of putting sugar in it. So far, I have used this coffee in my espresso machine to make cappuccinos.<br /><br />First, let me comment on the crema. I was expecting more. From reading other reviews, I expected the thickest crema I'd ever seen. In fact, the crema is about the same as with most brands of coffee I use in my machine. Depending upon how fine I grind the coffee, how much coffee I use, and how tightly I pack the coffee, the crema is better or worse. This brand didn't make any noticeable difference.<br /><br />From a flavor standpoint, I find this coffee rather weak. It might be okay straight up as espresso, but once I add steamed milk, it's quite watery. I brewed it side by side with Costco's Kirkland Espresso (Starbuck's roast), and the Kirkland brand is much bolder and more intense.<br /><br />So if you're looking for a strong coffee, one with intense flavor, this isn't the coffee for you.",3
"This is the 4th Red Leaf matcha I've tried, and my favorite so far! The flavors are perfectly pie-y: clove, cinnamon, nutmeg, ginger, and of course pumpkin! It is JUST like a warm slice of pumpkin pie. Of course, the flavoring doesn't overshadow the nice, grassy matcha at all. They compliment each other perfectly, heavy dense pumpkin and light summery frothy matcha. This is best as a hot latte with a bit of sugar, such a nice treat.",5
I had a hard time drinking this tea as it tastes like cardboard! There's no taste or flavor. I don't know if it actually works to strengthen the uterus as I wasn't able to make myself have it for the couple of months required. I'm not sure if all raspberry tea tastes like this or just this brand.,2

These bars come two in a package (and two to a serving size!) and are absolutely delicious.  They are crunchy and rich. The peanut butter bars taste like they are made with actual peanut butter holding the grains together.  The white chocolate macadamia nut bars have little pieces of soy white chocolate in the bars and you can taste them when you bite in.  These bars can keep me full for a while and are a great snack.

"FIRST THOUGHTS: BRINGS BACK OLD MEMORIES<br /><br />When I recently tried these little wafers I recalled when I worked in an office nearly 20 years ago. Whenever the Director skipped lunch, he ran all through the department pleading with all the ladies to pull something out of their handbags or desks that might get him through till 5 O'clock. He usually ended up with a couple of packaged saltines which had long since turned stale and were mostly crumbled from being crushed at the bottom of a handbag or desk drawer. I came to realize that some of the girls kept stale crackers just for him - I guess they really admired him. These 'Nabisco Oreo Thin Crisps, Baked Chocolate Wafer Snacks' would have served his purposes much better than the saltines, but I would rather he have more of his old favorites.<br /><br />IN A NUTSHELL: NICE FOR A DIETER AT COFFEE BREAK TIME -- BUT NO CREAM & SUGAR PLEASE<br /><br />Basically, this is a minimalist snack for people who have to eat something in-between meals and they don't want it to be a 600 calorie confection. That's why the biggest print on the label says, ""100 calorie packs"" -- 4.5 inches across!<br /><br />WHAT'S THIS STUFF ALL ABOUT: ENRICHED FLOUR + SUGAR + ""ARTIFICIAL FLAVORS"" & ""ARTIFICIAL COLORS"" & A LITTLE CANOLA OIL<br /><br />2 GRAMS OF FAT & 9 GRAMS OF SUGAR in a 23 GRAM PACKAGE = 100 CALORIES<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: NO PRETENSES -- SIMPLE LEAN SUGAR WAFER WITH THE USUAL ADDITIVES<br /><br />As diet snacks go this is okay stuff to carry with you. One can avoid more calorie dense alternatives with these wafers on hand, making them a sort of antidote or vaccine against dropping energy and blood-sugar levels in the late afternoon which may lead to a large unplanned snack. For that purpose this is a great product and I know that our Director, 20 years ago, would have given anything to have these modest wafers available instead of the usual stale saltines that he subsisted on for many a long afternoon. When the Director didn't find any saltines around the office he'd head straight for McDonalds and the rest was history.",4
"This is for the Chicken & Brown Rice Canned Cat Food Formula<br /><br />My cat (now 15 yrs old) has always been a picky eater.  The only cat food he would eat consistently was Whiskas canned cat food. But alas, they discontinued that product line, switching to pouches and tubs (both of which he refuses to eat).  He will eat 9 Lives from time to time, but it gives him gas and appears to be high in fat (based on the pool of fat when can is dumped out in dish).  I have desperately tried numerous brands and flavors of cats foods for a number of years, but to no avail (Some brands and flavors I could get him to eat for a day or two, but then he refuses to eat it any longer).<br /><br />Then I came across Newman's Organic Chicken & Brown Rice at Dillon's Grocery (owned by Krogers) during a stay in Hutchinson, Kansas and he LOVES IT!  And, it appears to be fairly low in fat, which is a huge plus for an elderly cat with liver troubles (he currently has to be given Denosyl, which is also available on Amazon, to keep his liver in check).<br /><br />For those unaware, a cat with liver troubles is recommended to receive a low fat, low sodium diet, with no fish meal and no organ meat.  I've read online that vets recommend chicken and brown rice blended cat food. So, while I dont know exactly how much sodium, fat, and organ meat this product has (ingredients do list chicken liver, ocean whitefish, and sea salt), it appears to fit the bill (Ie: it doesnt have a pool of liquid fat when put in the dish) and so far my cat is doing well on this product (at long as I continue to medicate him with Denosyl, due to his liver disease - which helps protect the liver and keep the bile production down to a minimum).<br /><br />Unlike most other canned cat foods, he eats the entire can and begs for another!  Today he's eaten every bite of FIVE of the small 3oz sized cans!<br /><br />Ounce to ounce, it's a little more expensive than some canned cat foods, but well worth it in my opinion, especially since none of it is going to waste (whereas with other brands I have been going through 3-5 5oz cans of the other brands of cat food, twice a day - morning meal and evening meal - simply to find one that he will eat and then he only eats 1/2 to 2/3 of one of them for each meal, which makes for up to 9 wasted 5 oz cans a day!).  So, in the long run it's cheaper for me at least, and no headaches of trying to get him to eat something.<br /><br />I'm am extremely happy with the product and my cat is very happy with it as well.",5
"These are great! The crust is light and flaky, and the lemon filling is ""to die for."" I was always afraid they were horrible, and never bought them until I saw the great reviews. They taste as good as the freshly baked bars, that I love, and are super easy to make.",5
"This product, whether you make a small, medium, or large cup, smells extremely good, yet when you go to drink it, all you taste is water & I like light roast coffee, this is not light roast it is like hot water brewed back out.",2
"Love the stuff.  Sent it to my daughter.  She used it for Halloween treats at school (2 kids) and home and as an afternoon snack.  I think it is a great treat.  Bags are perfect size for kids, big taste, light texture.",5
this is the best protein bar i have ever had.  I tend to eat on the go and I have had one for breakfast almost every weekday day for the past 5 months! A little high in sat fat but it's worth it.,5
"This is a very nice product.  Very fresh, great flavor.  Nice size container. Rehydrates in water.  Use in anything you want to get veggies in.  But, I think shipping is a little high for 1 container. Seeing as I had never tried this before, I didn't want to get a lot, and not care for it.  but, next time, I will order more, to save shipping.",4
"I first tried this cereal in Orlando, in 2008.  It was really good.  Two years later we bought some more at Publix while in Florida again on vacation.  This time I wrote the name down and sought it in Ohio when we returned home.  Nobody had it.  Finally I found it on Amazon.<br /><br />Why do we like it?  The taste is really good, and I was surprised that it only had 7 grams of sugar.  In this day of escalating diabetic conditions, we try to limit our sugar as a preventative measure.  Newman's cereal is a well balanced blend of taste & healthy ingredients.  We need more like it!",5
"These crackers are healthier for you than most, and yet are very tasty and light.  I really enjoy them.",5
"They had the potential of being great chips, but of the entire carton of 12 packages, none of them were fresh. I would not order them again, being apprehensive of receiving a stale item again.",3
"I'll be honest, I decided to try these mainly because they are made here in America, and I don't have to worry about some toxic Chinese ingredients. My dog must really love them too, judging by his eagerness to do his tricks when these are in the treat bag.",5
"Honey Nut Clusters, in my opinion, is the best cereal out on the market. Too bad I have to order it offline, since the groceries stores in my area stop carrying it. I have tried ""similar"" products but none compare to Honey Nut Cluster and I am sure nothing will ever compare to it. I have called General Mills to congratulate them on branding such a great cereal that is both kid and adult friendly. Sorry but I am a nut for Honey ""nut"" clusters. :-)",5
"Very good price for the product when purchased with the subscribe and save!  Very tasty too, my little one enjoys them!",5
"I consider myself somewhat of a coffee expert.  I have tried all types and prices of coffee brewed in every type of container (from french presses to drip makers to keurig and pod devices to cappuccino machines).  Most coffee can be made successfully if it is allowed to steep the properly ground coffee beans for the right amount of time at the right temperature.  Assuming you have the temperature and time calibrated right the end product will show its true nature to you.  In the instance if Marley Coffee & Tea One Love Organic Coffee, its true nature is quite good.  It has an earthy, exotic, African flavor that is bold and strong - just the way I like my coffee.  It makes for a perfect after dinner coffee - to be enjoyed with friends and good conversation.  I took off one star for the price, as I feel it is a bit overpriced as sold.  Otherwise enjoy this great coffee!",4
"There are two recipes on the can; one for pancakes and one for waffles. Look at the one for waffles.<br /><br />Am I the only one in the world who doesn't know what '5 oz. cup water' means???<br /><br />I figured it out, but come on, Carbon, is this a 75 year tradition of no proofreading?  :)",4
The Berres Brothers Coffee was excellent.  The flavor Highlander Grogg is my favorite.  I choose whole bean coffee because I like to grind my own coffee every morning.  The coffee was delivered very fast and it was packaged well.<br />I was very pleased with my order and will order it again from Amazon.,5
Delicious!  No red dye on shell to stain hands.  Superb flavor.  Most shells can be easily cracked fully open with bare hands. Best Pistachios I've ever eaten!,5
"Super tasty, super delicious. Best tea ever, sweet and cinnamony. I actually like these better than the individually wrapped tea bags.",5
"My sister in law gave our dog a box of these treats for Christmas.  We have a new puppy and he loves them.  We taught him to ""sit"" in one day with these, we broke them in half, and he thinks they are great.  We had success so I passed a box on to two of my friends who just got puppies, they love them too...I told them to go to Amazon for the best deal.  They always have what I want at a great price and delivery is quick.",5
I have been buying bulk tea for years and the quality and flavor of this tea is excellent and the added bonus of being able to afford a tea that is certified organic is fantastic.,5
I know some people will say "aw you just don't know nothing about chocolate" or "aw you didn't major in chocolate in college" or "aw you and Stalin have the same taste in chocolate so who will listen to you" but believe it or not I did not find these great or worth bragging on.  I loved the dark chocolate and the milk I had before from Leonidas and I finished them in a day.  These I found to be rather bland and after eating a couple I was ready to give them up and eat something else.  I found them really enjoyable though with a nice hot cup of coffee.  With the taste in mind I even let my wife taste and she agreed that these are not of the same taste quality as what we had before.  I think some people will eat these and love them and think they are great but they are just not for me.  Its kind of like when my brother use to eat ketchup sandwiches and loved them so I decided to try it and the taste just wasn't for me and in fact was quite terrible.  I am not a trying to be a jerk but I find that a lot of people have a hard time believing that we all don't have the same taste but I hope if they struggle with my review they will seek help and counseling and come to an understanding.,3
I purchased this for my son for a Christmas gift and he loved it.  He puts it on everything.,5
The beans came well packaged and in time. We have never had a problem with these beans. They have always been good in quality.,5
"Love, love this item.  I bought the regular and chocolate and enjoy them both.  I mix mine equal parts powder a<br />& water and it is perfect on crackers, as a dipper or just off the spoon for a quick protein rich, low fat snack.<br /><br />I have also used it in protein shakes and diped raw apple and pear slices right into the powder too!<br /><br />Yum.<br />Try it!",5
This was a great deal for only 8 bucks!<br /><br />It was shipped way before Amazon subscribed said it would be and arrived to my son's campus on the very day the scam of a college meal plan ended.<br /><br />My son isn't a big fan of Chef Boyardee ravioli but i don't care..<br /><br /> i told him he better pretend it's tiny empanadas with sauce and eat it or continue to starve until u get a J O B and able to buy your own food.<br /><br />Personally I enjoy Chef Boyardee ravioli with cheese.,5
"I'm a cereal fanatic, but I've got celiac so I have to choose gluten free cereals. I bought this as a substitute for Rice Krispies so that I could make my favorite cookies, which require that type of rice cereal. The pieces in this cereal are a bit bigger than Rice Krispies. I'm not sure if it was the sweetener or the brown rice, but the flavor just did not appeal to me at all. So I didn't even bother trying to make my cookies. I actually threw out most of the box, which I never do, because every time I tried eating it, it just didn't taste good. I tried it with regular milk and almond milk (I thought maybe the almond milk would flavor it better, nope). I did not have any sort of gluten-related reaction to it. I just didn't like it, and neither did my non-celiac husband.",1
"I had an enormous hope for this ""patent-pending"" technology and was shocked to find that this product doesn't taste like anything. I thought is was just me and tested it on several genetically different individuals. Everybody had the same perception. Several companies distribute this product under different labels.<br /><br />I found a small maker who takes custom orders, and she made incredible chocolate sweetened only with xylitol! Again, tested on several people. E-mail her: cocosrawchocolates at yahoo.",1
"The box says this is a meal and @ $5.00 and 400 calories it should be a meal, it's not. Inside the box there are packages of crackers, a nut fruit mix, chili lime salmon, edamame and a square of chocolate. When I opened the box I was a little disappointed at the serving size of the chili lime salmon compared to the size of the edamame.  For the price I would expect more salmon and less edamame to make up the 22gms of protein, my mistake. The salmon looks like baby food but it is tasty. There is a fork and not a knife in the box which makes it hard to get all of the salmon from the little container. The edamame is over dried with not much taste. It gets kind of powdery when you chew it and it made me cough from the texture getting caught in the back of my throat. You'll need a lot of water to wash them down with. I had to give up eating them because they kept choking me. I did enjoy the fruit and nut mix and the chocolate was really good so it wasn't a total loss.<br />I consider the the price to be the biggest negative in this review. At almost $5.00 a box this is an expensive snack. I won't be buying this.",2
"14g of carbs and 5g of fiber, dark chocolate and almonds, plus 10g of Protein, these are a great alternative to the supermarket ""granola"" bars.  Love them!",5
"This amazing coffee scored a 92 from Ken Davids and Coffee Review, which are the most well-known and respected reviewers of coffees in the world.  A score between 85 and 89 means it is very good and considered a specialty coffee.  Any score of 90 and above represents an Outstanding Coffee.  92 is an unusually high score for a Fair Trade Organic coffee!  Amazing coffee at an awesome value!

"Two level measuring teaspoons makes at least 30 ounces of tea, good strong tea that is highly stimulating.  I don't even miss coffee now!  Using distilled water makes the best tea in my opinion.  I drink the first mug straight and the rest I put soy milk powder in.  GOOD STUFF.  Will continue to buy this tea.",5
"It's plain nori.  It's very dry.  It's edible.  It tastes like the sea.<br /><br />I prefer this over <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B001PBKZK8"">Zero Gravity Hawaii's Nori</a>, and over all salty nori snacks (which have way too much oil)<br /><br />If you like to eat this without anything else, just drink water at the same time.",5
"First of all, this is a 10% Kona BLEND, it is not 100% Kona coffee!<br />Second, it is a 7 oz. bag, which is less than 1/2 pound.<br />For the price, you would do better to go direct to the Lion Coffee site. So much for rarity.<br />As for flavor, it's not much better than cafeteria coffee. I found it lacking in aroma and flavor.<br /><br />Granted, the lion is a great looking brand, and it makes a cool souvenir to bring back to friends but, like the Macadamia nuts, it tastes much better in the islands. Save your money and buy a keychain instead. If you're looking for a nice Kona blend, keep looking.",2
"I fell in love with this tea a couple of years ago. The problem is, you cannot get it where I live. Amazon.com has the best price I have found. I can get it in bulk with free shipping! Gotta love free shipping. As always with amazon.com, fast delivery.",5
"I really only needed the funnel/pitcher, but it was easy and neat to make funnel cakes. I had been using a kitchen funnel, which made a big mess no matter how careful I was. I didn't use the ring because I made the funnel cakes in a small deep fryer. The mix was fine, but I prefer my own recipe. If I could have just bought the funnel/pitcher, that would have been fine and saved me some money, but I'm not disappointed.",4
"I would like to say that I have never tried a flavor of jerky that I didn't like...  that was true until a few days ago.  I wanted to try something different and decided to stray from my usual peppered beef.  This was a mistake, I have to say this is the worst jerky/nuggets/meat product I have ever tried.  From the smell to the taste, just not good.  If you really want to give this stuff a whirl, I suggest you find a single pack.  Don't buy 4 of them like I did.  One final note:  taste is subjective, you may really love this stuff, I just didn't.",2
This came nicely packaged and is a good seller. But be aware<br />that this is one of the harder plants to grow. You have to<br />have a green thumb and no how this likes to be watered. I lost mine about 1 month after I got it.... Good luck with yours!,4
"I have to say I love EVO-- my yorkie use to poop 3-5 times a day-- he is a small dog so you would think he wouldn't poop that much. I wasn't overfeeding him, that is for sure..  My dog trainer recommended EVO-- I resisted because of the added cost but my husband kept telling me to buy it. I finally gave in to keep peace in the family and I swear within days my dog stopped pooping as much-- now we are down to about 2 times a day sometimes 3.  It's a great product and my dog really loves the food-- I would recommend it -",4
"Several months ago my coworkers and I opted to by a coffee grinder and beans to enhance our coffee experience at work.  At the time we were swapping back and forth between the locally produced Red Diamond ground coffee and Eight O'Clock ground coffee.  So when ordering the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00004SPEU"">KRUPS 203-42 Electric Spice and Coffee Grinder with Stainless Steel blades, Black</a> we also chose to order this bag of Eight O'Clock coffee beans.  We immediately noticed the big difference in taste between ground coffee and freshly ground beans and we all loved the change.  It took the three of us a few months to go through this bag of coffee beans and as we were nearing the bottom, we decided to try other brands of beans.  So we bought a bag of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000SDKDM4"">Lavazza Super Crema Espresso Whole Bean Coffee, 2.2-Pound Bag</a> and had ourselves a 2 day double blind taste test.  I ground up fresh beans from the Lavazza, Red Diamond beans we bought at a local grocery store, and the Eight O'Clock beans.  All three bags of beans were freshly opened only a day or three apart.  I measured each coffee equally and ran it through our <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B000F49XXG"">De'Longhi EC155 15 BAR Pump Espresso and Cappuccino Maker</a>.  I presented each of the coffees to two different coworkers for comparison and opinions.  Without them knowing which coffee was which, the general consensus was our local favorite was not anywhere near the quality and flavor as the Lavazza and the Eight O'Clock.  Our taste tests placed Lavazza slightly behind the Eight O'Clock with flavor being the only measure.  Once we also took into consideration that the Eight O'Clock coffee was not a blend like Lavazza and it cost half the price, we all decided the Eight O'Clock 100% Columbian Whole Bean coffee was definitely the better choice for us.",5
"My grandmother is a sucker for a good gingersnap cookie.  She's very difficult to please.  So I put these cookies to the true test - I handed them over to her.  Nana's assessment is the following.<br /><br />""They were an excellent cookie.  Better than any storebought gingersnap I've had since I was a kid!  They were super crunchy, but not hard to bite.  And the ginger flavor was very strong, which I love.  So many times you get a gingersnap that tastes nothing like ginger and that's very disappointing.  These were nothing like that.  They were delicious!""<br /><br />I sampled some myself and, though I'm not as big a gingersnap fan in general, I have to admit that Nana was spot on in her assessment.  The reason I only awarded 4 stars to these cookies because I do have a minor disclaimer: To me, the ginger flavor was almost TOO strong.  It wasn't at all overpowering.  But it was so strong that it kept growing in the back of my mouth until I felt a tingle in my throat.  I think that might be too much for a lot of people, hence the reason I couldn't in good conscience award full stars.<br /><br />I'd say they were a solid 4 1/2 though.  This is an excellent cookie and definitely better than any other I've ever bought for my family!",4
"I was so excited to get these cookies from the vine program.  I had seen the commericals on t.v., and I thought they looked yummy.  When I received the cookies, a lot of them were broken and/or stuck together.  The ""gooey"" aspect wasn't gooey but one big chip  of chocolate in the middle.  To me, they were too sweet and not the best quality of chocolate.  I am not a huge fan of the original, but I prefer them to this new cookie.  I would not buy these, but on a side note, my four year old and two year old seemed to like them.",2
"This was easy to dissolve in either cold or hot water.  It's a pretty strong ginger taste, which I like.  If you are a fan of ginger ale or love ginger you will probably enjoy this.  I also get car sick easily and bringing a long water bottle with some of this is a great way to ease my upset stomach.<br /><br />I would recommend to people who enjoy the taste of ginger.  I would also recommend as a great cure for upset stomachs, especially those caused by motion sickness.",4
Arrived on time.  What a deal !!! So glad I could find this product on amazon !  I used this when i feel like im getting sick<br />Thanks !,5
"Since our little one was diagnosed with multiple food allergies our options have been limited.  We make everything from scratch, of course, but sometimes, it is nice to be able to toss something in the diaper bag that requires no work and is a little sturdier than home-baked goodies.  These are it!  We can't really distinquish the animals too well, but that aside, for allergy-free treats, these cookies taste great!  Any child who doesn't take to them right away should just be offered them again & again...eventually they will appreciate them with gusto!  Our daughter did.  It is hard to adjust to allergy-free eating in general, especially if your kids have had the pleasure of tasting ""normal"" food.  Now she LOVES these cookies, though, and for me it is a convenient & simple treat to give her.",5
"Amazon had this as buy one get one free and since it was my favorite, I could not resist.  Great purchase.",5
"I have to agree with several other reviews here that state the ""The Switch Orange Tangerine"" is too sweet on it's own. I ended up making a cool summer drink out of the can that I tried - served over ice & mixed with soda water. It was fantastic! The soda water/ice mixture helps cut down on the sweetness and improves on the refreshment factor.<br /><br />A little more about ""The Switch""... The can claims that this product is 100% Carbonated Juice with ""No Sugar Added"" and ""No Preservatives"". One can is 8.3 fluid ounces and provides 140 Calories. Total Sugars per can are 34g; 36g of carbs. One can provides 100% of the daily recommended dose of Vitamin C.<br /><br />That being said, I can't see myself drinking ""The Switch"" everyday. Even without preservatives and added sugars this drink still packs in a lot of sugar in every can. Though to be fair, I rarely drink soda or sweetened carbonated beverages. Still, for a nice alternative to the standard soda I recommend ""The Swtich"". The Tangerine flavor is reminiscent of Tang.",4
"I have ordered this a few times over the past couple years. It is always a crowd pleaser.  Everything is precooked - all you have to do is heat and eat.  The ribs are fantastic.  I have also gotten the BBQ combo - The ribs are very meaty and the smoke is perfect.  Considering shipping is included, these are nicely priced. I have sent Burgers ribs and combos to family members as gifts and all have raved about them.  I have not tried the hams, sausages, bacon etc just the BBQ sampler and the ribs so far.  I would definately buy again.",5

"I bought this olive oil because it was the top rated by America's Test Kitchen, and I wasn't disappointed.  It has excellent flavor and color - much better than anything I've been able to find at the local stores.  I use it primarily for dipping bread and for salads, as the flavor is too good to use for cooking - I use my regular supermarket olive oil for that.  Highly recommended.",5
"I don't typically buy or snack on granola bars. They are often more chewy than like a crisp cookie and taste of honey and artificial ingredients. In fact, I would never have tried these were there not a sample bowl of them at a local grocery store.<br /><br />I was more than shocked...it almost tasted like a homemade oatmeal cookie.  In fact it was so good I returned for seconds and bought 2 boxes of these and 3 other flavors as well. Although the chocolate chip is a close second, these are hands down the best in my opinion.<br /><br />Surprisingly the calorie count on the box is for TWO bars. While many manufacturers try to sneak in calories by doing things like saying there are 2 servings in soda can or 2 servings in a single frozen dinner so the calorie count looks smaller, they were more than generous. TWO bars of most of their flavors have only 160 calories and for a mega sweet fix that satisfies me plenty with just one bar, that wowed me.<br /><br />This is an organic bar and they are actually vegan. Not that they advertise this anywhere, I just read labels and was surprised to see no dairy or eggs listed. One servings gives you 40% of your daily recommended serving of whole grains yet it tastes like a cookie or dessert...and that also means a nice doce of fiber.<br /><br />While I wouldn't fool myself into thinking that I'm eating HEALTHY just because of the whole grains and organic ingredients...it is, afterall, sweet and has 11g of sugar (but that's for two bars, remember, and one is plenty filling for me so that's not so bad for a sweet snack.) I do feel I am eating healthier than most alternatives when I'm craving a sweet snack that I can tote in a purse or keep in my desk drawer. Most bow far deeper into the less healthy alternatives of preservatives to keep them shelf-stable, or far more sugar.<br /><br />Not to be confused with a protein bar or one packed with vitamins, of which it's not, it's still a healthy alternative to the afternoon candy bar or morning donut in the break room and in my opinion it tastes way better than either.",5
"We love the plain PopChips (seasoned with salt only).  These salt & pepper chips are very spicy, so you only want to buy these if you REALLY like that black pepper burn.  Also, there IS enough GLUTEN in the product to cause a reaction IF YOU ARE ""ALLERGIC"" TO GLUTEN.  I found that eating them once in a while was not a big deal, but eating them frequently truly was/is a problem for me.  They taste GOOD, but be careful if you have food allergies.  Just sayin'...",4

"I love eating these candies.  The only reason that I am not giving them a 5th star is that they are very attached to the wrapper.  I can be a bit of a sticky business to get them from the bag onto the tongue, but the taste is worth it. And 10 calories per pop is not too much given their rich flavor and sweetness.",4

"Well, there is no denying that Temptations knows exactly what cats like to taste.<br />Much like putting MSG in people treats, they have figured out a combination that makes<br />cats go crazy for their treats.<br /><br />HOWEVER - most Temptations are chock-full of grain fillers that cats do not need and do not eat<br />on their own if they are outside cats.  For that reason, we had stopped buying Temptations entirely,<br />even though it was their favorite. It was like junk potato chips for humans, but we were hurting our<br />cats.<br /><br />When we saw this flavor, we thought we'd give it a try, since they both love catnip. (Not all cats<br />respond to catnip.)  I read the back, and it was not quite as gross as their other flavors, but still<br />something that needs to be occasional only or very limited usage.<br /><br />Both cats really liked these.  They only get a three-star rating from me, because Temptations seems to be<br />too cheap to put decent quality foods in their treats. For a pet food manufacturer, they seem to only<br />focus on the costs, not what the HEALTHY part is for your cats. But, I eat some things that aren't good for<br />me either from time to time, so for a sometimes-treat, this one will do.",3
I'm a huge fan of the McCormick brand gravy mix and I assumed that this would be as good.  It isn't.  It's not bad enough for a 2 but i'm annoyed that i convinced myself to buy a case of this stuff instead of the McCormick.,3
"Though I don't know if this particular one is recalled.<br />But I just thought I'd try to give a heads up.<br />So, this is not a true review about this products features per say.....but I feel that everyone needs to know that this company has recalled their products and it is going on right now.<br />To begin with, I want to say that I know that unfortunately there are plenty of human products that get recalled too and that is the most important thing. And yes, I know that every time we go eat out or buy any type of store bought food.... that it is a gamble too.<br />But, my family considers our dogs as part of the family and this is very important too.<br /><br />Many years ago I did research to find the best priced grain free,no dye or by product food.<br />I found that some of the food made by Diamond Pet Foods had the first ingredient as being the actual real meat.<br />Plus,the grain free ones made my baby girl look so healthy and shiny.<br />Also,since it had no fillers and quality ingredients it actually made her stool smaller and less stinky.<br />She has less allergies and it stopped most of her constant itching/biting/licking at her paws and less tear stains.<br />She actually loved the product, by the same maker, named ""Taste Of The Wild"" in Bison the most.<br /><br />But,I am saddened now because Diamond Dog Food has now been RECALLED for ""SALMONELLA CONTAMINATION""<br />This company makes various products that have been recalled.<br />Such as:<br />Diamond Naturals, Wellness, Natural Balance, Taste of The Wild, Apex, Chicken Soup Soul, Canidae, Country Value, 4Health, Natural Balance, Kirkland Signature, Natural Balance, Premium Edge, Professional and Solid Gold.<br /><br />I am saddened that we actually spend more money on these ""better than store"" dog food and they keep getting recalled!<br />So many families have unfortunately lost their fur babies babies and have spent thousands of dollars on Vet bills....when all we are trying to do is buying the ""better"" which are higher priced, dog food ingredients.<br />I am pretty thankful that I had signed up online,for emails about the latest dog food recalls last week.<br />My hubby and I was devastated to see that Diamond Dog Foods, Taste Of The Wild was on the list now.<br />I am sickened by these companies being so careless. When the reason we buy their higher priced food is cuz they are suppose to be healthier!<br />I just wanted to write this and try to stop another baby from getting sick or even worse dying",1
Very expensive and didn't work any better than popping an over the counter caffeine pill. And you don't have that horrible taste!,1
"I wish I had listened to the reviewer who said this is ""sometimes really bad.""  This shipment of crystallized ginger is old, dry & disgusting! And I have 5 lbs of it!  This quality is horrible, & I cannot eat it.<br /><br />This was my first purchase from Bayside Candies.  I love crystallized ginger, and this was the better deal with 5 lbs for approx. $20.  I have bought this ginger from Amazon before, but from a different company.  The other company's was $9 for only 16 oz.  It was fresh and delicious.  I am very disappointed with my purchase.  I could kick myself!",1
"Of course they were delicious, but they could have been packaged much better.  1/3 of the scoops were crushed.... cest la vie, they were still good!",4
"One of my cats liked this food, although not as much as he liked the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food, and my other cat wouldn't touch this food; however, she does like the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety. This variety of food comes with chunks of chicken, chunks of vegetables and gravy. I'm guessing my finicky cat was turned off by the vegetable chunks. On the positive side these cans are easy to open and you can pour the food out without having to use a spoon. However, because one of my cats wouldn't touch this food I won't buy it again. I'll stick with the Petite Cuisine Seafood Variety Cat Food.",3
This product is so very convenient when traveling to dog shows.  High quality and the dogs love it. I received this product quickly and just as I expected.,5
"The Eden Cannellini beans have a nice texture and a simple flavor that blends well with other foods. I also find them more digestible than some other beans.<br /><br />Good mashed as well as whole, I have used them in place of tahini with garbanzo beans to make a nice, light hummos, mashed them and mixed them with seafood and herbs/spices to make a South-American (Brazilian?) style fritter (dried shrimp is traditional I gather, but anything you like can be good -- the beans hold everything together and are mild enough to let the other flavors shine through. Lightly dredging in flour gives you a crisper surface if you decide to try it...), and more.",5
"My wife loves this tea and has got me hooked on it also, so we use it often.  To us it is like a comfort food with a mildly sweet taste (but with no sugar or carbs) and we much prefer it to all other teas.  Buying it from Amazon is much cheaper than getting it from the local grocery, and buying it as a Grocery Subscribe and Save results in even a further savings.",5
"My cats love these treats, but eat them too fast. They don't take as much chewing and crunching as I expected them to. Breath is a little fresher, but I am still waiting to see long term effects for keeping their teeth cleaner.",4
I ordered this coffee for my Bunn Single Cup coffee maker.  I have been having a terrible time finding coffee pods in the stores and I haven't had luck with the Keurig coffee maker.  This coffee is a little bitter but it is strong and has a deep flavor.  Certainly a lot cheaper than replacing my coffee machine.,4
"I make espresso on a Krups machine with Cafe Lavazza. In comparison to Cafe Bustelo, which has a boring, but tolerable strong dark roast espresso flavor, Lavazza espresso has a more unique, rich syrupy flavor.<br /><br />However, if I compare Lavazza to the beans that I bought at Four Barrel in San Francisco last week, Lavazza's flavor seems pretty boring. I give it 4 stars because it is a great deal for the price and has good flavor.",4
I love that it only has two ingrediants:  chicken and vitamin E.  And better yet?  It's all made in the USA!  I will continue buying these!,5
"Yes, they stink - like rotting fish! You can rinse the smell away and add whatever you like, BUT the consistency of these noodles (I got the angel hair and prepared with my favorite homemade spaghetti sauce) is very rubbery. After smelling them initially, and then feeling as though I was chewing on tiny earthworms, I managed to down two forkfuls and threw the rest away. Color me crazy, but I'd rather have half a cup of real, delicious, high-carb pasta than a gallon of Miracle Noodles. What's that you said? Would I care for more Miracle Noodles? No, thanks, I'm having portion control.",1
"These are so hard to find, but they taste wonderful.  Not too hot, not too mild.  I love keeping these in the car.",5
This coffee tastes like colored water.  It has no flavor.<br />I like Emeril's regular Big Bold coffee and thought it would taste similar.<br />Don't waste your money,1
"This is the second month we've ordered this coffee and love it!  If you like a strong cup of coffee, this is it.  And, the price can't be beat!",4
"This bar is the best tasting low sugar bar I've had.<br />I am however concerned about the Maltitol in the bar.<br />This substance is used as a sweetener and I think it's synthetic.<br />I've also read that it helps Aluminum cross the blood brain<br />barrier, yikes!  I really love these bars but I'm going to look<br />for something else, because of the Maltitol.  Honestly, I think<br />I'm just going to have to make my own.",2
By far this is the best tasting instant cup of coffee I've ever had! And the individual serving size is so convenient and gives a consistent taste every time. Not as cheap as buying a jar of instant but well worth the cost if you want a tasty cup of coffee but don't have the time and equipment for a brewed cup.,5
"One of my guilty pleasures has become a little less guilty . . . Post has added a source of fiber to bring the suggested serving up to 4 grams.  Yeah!  Malt-o-Meal and I believe Kellogg's brand is still down around 1 gram of fiber per serving.  It's still pretty sugary, though, but as a late night dessert it beats ice cream!  Have always loved this cereal.",5
"I have tried this cake mix 3 times and each time it turned out disgusting.  The texture is rubbery, gummy and a very unusual non-appealing flavor.  My family finally said ""please mom don't try it again"".  And, I won't! Their chocolate cake is the best by far.  I was told to stick to that one.  Since I have to be on a gluten free diet I was really hoping that this vanilla cake mix would be good.  Unfortuantely it's the most disgusting vanilla cake I've ever had.  Even tried disguising the taste with vanilla pudding and fresh berries.  Didn't make it.  The awful taste of the cake was front and center.  My recommendation - Don't waste your money.",1
"Great!And drink coffee in the store, and the price is very affordable.I would like my future will continue to buy.",5
"I've been drinking this coffee ever since my best friend's mom introduced it to me in HS. This is by far the best tasting store bought coffee, Maxwell House and Folgers can't compare. I like strong coffee and its still strong even after I add cream and sugar. Its also great iced.",5
"I threw this away after about a week of ownership.  Couldn't get the clear plastic cover on and off without spilling water all over, and half the time, I couldn't get it off at all.  It only works for long stemmed herbs, and all need to be about the same height.",1
"Great ingredients!  Really healthy.  Good buy!  Only problem.  Even after I read him the ingredients, my dog won't touch them, even when he's hungry.  :(",1
I'm a bit out of shape and getting back into shape hasn't been easy with all the soreness. A friend recommended Cytomax and it has really helped. While exercising I can do more reps than in the past and when I get 6 or 7 sets deep into my workout my reps only fall off slightly compared to before I was trying Cytomax. The other day I did a workout that I'd done 2 weeks before but this time I did not use Cytomax and the soreness that I am experiencing today is unpleasant to say the least. My experiment showed me that without using Cytomax I get considerable soreness the following day(s) whereas when I did use Cytomax I had relatively little soreness. Until I get back in shape I think I'm going to need this crutch. I'm 42 years old so that means that I experience a lot more soreness than a younger athlete. Someone younger and in better shape may not notice such a difference.,5
"IT TASTE SOUR! it taste more like expired curry, and yes I did check the expiration date. I wasted good beef and chicken for this sauce. The after taste is horrible, avoid at all cost, this is the worst curry I've ever had in my life.",1
"These crunchy snacks are healthy, addictive, and tasty. I love the crisp texture, the flavors, and the perfect size for a snack. Much better than the Apple Chips that have all that added junk and sugar. These Sensible Foods Snacks are just dried fruit! Love the apple harvest flavor best, then tropical blend. A favorite snack item!",5
"Don't count on this to keep you awake because of its caffeine content.  If anything, you might get a sugar high.  ""Instant coffee"" is the fifth ingredient after ""sugar,"" ""non-dairy creamer,"" ""maltodextrin"" and ""cocoa.""  In fact, it tastes much more like a specialty cocoa than it does a coffee.  Nice blend of peppermint and mocha flavors.  Certainly won't win any ""healthy food"" awards, but you probably know that already.  Fifty calories per serving, fifteen of which come from fat.  Nine grams of sugar.<br /><br />As with many hot-mix-type beverages, recommends 6 oz of milk or water per 4 tsp of product.  I used 4 tbsp (that's tablespoons) instead and was impressed with the intensity of taste.  Glad I tried it.",4
"My dog absolutely loves these and she is very picky however I am returning them due to the numorous recent cases of illnesses and deaths occurring from chicken treats that have been manufactured in China.<br />It is NOT worth the risk to me, sadly to say I will have to find another brand.",1
"We've always wondered why the Kettle Corn we got at fairs and festivals tasted so much better than what we tried to do at home. We finally learned that Mushroom popcorn makes for a much fluffier, fuller and superior bag of Kettle Corn! Determined to surprise my fiance for the holidays, I started a quest for Mushroom popcorn kernals and finally found JustPoppin. Eureka! I quickly ordered 2 lbs, along with the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0058IBRK6"">Stainless Steel Induction Stovetop Popcorn Popper</a> and we've been poppin' up a storm ever since! It took some practice (watch their videos) -- but we quickly mastered homemade Kettle Corn and now laugh every time we pass the grocery store brands. There's simply no comparison. JustPoppin's customer service and support is terrific, too. We've been ordering from them for over a year now and enjoy trying all their new varieties, flavorings and popping techniques!",5
"I love finding new K-Cups, but I don't always love spending a ton of money on cups that I hate. So the samplers are perfect! I love coffee and I love chocolate, so this is perfect. Came with a great variety of flavors. The few I've tried so far are really good. My only beef is with the packaging - I wish they'd put them in a smaller box.",4
"Fantastic ""toaster pastries"" aka Pop Tarts. Buying them in bulk as snacks for work makes them as cheap as Pop Tarts at much higher quality and taste, and organic to boot.  I have tried all the flavors, and Strawberry is my current favorite- although they are all good.<br /><br />Good company too- very involved in their community.",5
It tastes fine and the baby loves it. has DHA and is organic - which is important when having berries (but redundant when it comes to bananas),5
"A month in Australia, a half-price sale at Woolies, an entire case of Tim Tams came back in our luggage.  Should have brought 2 cases back since the sale price there was less than 25% of the price in the US.  :-(  Next trip to Australia check them out in many flavors, all delicious.  Try the coffee straw technique described in other reviews.",5
"I'm glad I read the reviews saying to only use a few drops in a beverage. Too many drops and it quickly goes from delicious to strange and bitter. The directions on the bottle say 5-8 drops, but I find 2 or 3 is perfect in a 12 oz drink or a cup of yogurt.",4
"I bought a Keurig, couldnt get it to prime, and kept returning this silly product and getting a new one, only to not have it work either.  Then, LO!, I watched the online video and finally learned it requires a water filter that is not included with the product!  That alone is mystifying to me--why would an essential component not be included, like water filters for water pitchers??  Really, it includes a bonus pack of coffee that you cant initially use but not the filter that you absolutely have to have?!?!<br /><br />More disturbing, however, is why the absence of this critical component is not disclosed on the box (a la, ""batteries not included"" notices), or in the instructions, or even by  the two brain trust customer service reps with whom I spent 30-45 minutes on the phone with on 2 separate occasions!!<br /><br />Finally, I had to spend a day tracking down this essential-but-rare-and-not-included component b/c I have clients coming to the office tomorrow and cant wait for the online ordering process....  It turns out most of the various retailers dont know it's not included yet necessary, so none of them stock it on hand!<br /><br />Brilliant, Keurig!",1
Love this oil. Smells heavenly. Wish I could eat it just like that. Use it om my hair but will cook with it one day.,5
These are adorable.  The product was wrapped exceptionally well upon arrival and arrived very soon after I placed the order.  I highly recommend doing business with them.,5
"Leave it to starbucks to enter into the ""me too"" market with an inflated price scheme. However, this product will flop as starbuck's consumers typically want to be seen holding a starbuck's cup so everyone will know they overspent. Since Keurig's coffee is typically consumed in the privacy of one's own home, starbuck's attempt to get in will certainly fail.",1
I love sour candies.  I am also a huge fan of Hot Tamales from Just Born.<br />I figured that sour Mike and Ike's would be awesome.  Ick.  They taste fake.<br />Sour Patch Kids are much better.,2
"I might be a bit partial in my judgment of the taste of this soup, because I have made it homemade before. I didn't care for the flavor of the soup. Even after adding a little sea salt it still did not have the right flavor. It had what seemed to be an almost tomato soup flavor. I particularly did not care for it, but everyone has different taste buds. This is just my opinion.",2
"Perfect for potty training, using as incentives for good behavior and much better for you than regular lollipos.",5
"I've been gluten free for a few years now and realize that getting decent gluten free products is not that easy. Baking them yourself seems to be the logical options, but cost and ability are great hindrances for many. I enjoy making pizza crust from scratch as I know exactly what is in it and in what quantities, and I can fudge the recipe to make a crispier or doughier pizza, depending on what I want. However, when one flour or another is out, or my starch is gone, or I'm visiting a friend or family member's house, I grab this pizza crust mix.<br />It mixes well every time without fail and tastes acceptable. Just as the other reviewers say, the crust isn't dry or crumbly, it holds together well, and makes a fair amount of pizza. It's nothing to write mom about, but it is decent, consistent pizza dough.",3
"We saw that some of the coffee reviews said that the coffee was weak when ""teabagged.""  We put a few pods of <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B005VOOLXM"">Marley Coffee One Love, One Heart</a> into our old-fashioned stovetop percolator and let the steam do its magic.<br /><br />Yum. Great flavor, and strong enough. Even though I prefer my coffee whitened and sweetened, I was surprised that I enjoyed the Marley Coffee black. This coffee was great alone, and would probably do well as a mixer for cooking or alcohol recipes.<br /><br />Next time, we may experimentally open the pods and try the in the Keurig; however, we *were* satisfied with the percolator.",4
"package arrived on time and in good condition.<br /><br />nice to try a bunch of flavors without having to buy an entire box of each.<br /><br />disapointed with duplicates, but think not a lot of them, and only think if duplicated got 2 of the same flavor/brand.<br /><br />considering is a medium roast sampler there where a couple ""bold"" and ""extra bold"" flavors that seem shouldnt have been in the pack.<br /><br />Will likely buy another sampler, just to keep a variety of k-cups on hand",4
I was notified that there was a mistake in price so my order was cancelled right away by the supplier.  I never received my item.,1
"This is a great alternative to chicken soup if you get sick. It will alkalinize you blood and help to get better much faster than you would normally do. Also try it in the morning instead of your regular cup of java - it will perk you up without the jitters of caffeine. True it has a lot of solium, but this sodium is from sea salt that brings with it much needed trace minerals. The seaweed veriety is the best. Open minded and adventurous folks will love it right away, for others it may take some time to get used to. Do try. Your body will thank you.",5
I get these for my son in law he loves them. I hope you continue to stock them or that lots of other people like it too so you will keep selling it.,5
"First, I'd like to say I'm a soda enthusiast,and enjoy a variety of brands - store brand regular brand. It's not that I can't tell the difference. I like to.<br /><br />However, diet lemon-lime is not different, it's NASTY.<br /><br />It has an incredibly bitter aftertaste. I drink diet sodas all the time and nothing has a bite like this. I kept trying it thinking I would like it or I did something wrong, but it tasted nasty every time.<br /><br />Having said that, I think it's worthy to note that SodaStream makes a variety of flavors, some of which are unique and delicious. In addition, I have made some drinks with this base by mixing in some tastier flavors.<br /><br />As another review stated, SodaStream does NOT save money. But it is pretty fun.",1
"I like these chips just a bit better than I liked the multigrain version.  The flavor here is unique in that you can actually taste the green and black olives - I think they hit just the right balance here, as well, not too much, not too little.  Salt level is good - I don't care for overly salty chips so these are good for me.  Very textured and multi-level flavor in that you can taste the individual ingredients.  I think they'd go well with a mild guacamole or a smooth cheese and some fruit; nothing should compete with the flavor of these chips.",5
"I have four cats; three of them absolutely love treats and the other one sometimes accepts them.  However, only one of my cats ate this treat. The other three cats wouldn't touch it; they just sniffed the treat and walked away.  The one that ate it is one of the treat lovers.<br /><br />Based on my cats' reaction, I say you have about a 25% chance of your cat liking these treats.",2
These were easy to fix and delicious!  My whole family loved them and they are a beautiful color in dishes!,5
I LOVE walnuts and I LOVE a great cup of cappuccino. The bar is pretty good but a bit sweet for my taste. The walnuts saves it from being too much of a candy bar. Sugar content is high for the size of the bar. I just balance it out with fage yogurt. (sugar ~protein). Packaging is great where I can see exactly what I'm buying and eating.,4
"This product honestly does what it promises and makes stirring natural peanut butter inside the jar so much easier and cleaner. The only fault is that the lid is not completely universal in fitting all jars, but I had no trouble holding it in place while stirring and it still did the job. I am thrilled with this product and wish I had found it sooner. -JR",4
"I have used this CDM in light yellow can for years.  I use one coffee scoop CDM and two of my favorite coffee from New Orleans for 25 ounces of water.  My children (50,51 and 48)prefer this measure. No local store handles this anymore.  That is why I am ordering and will share with Sons",5
No bitterness here...this is a hearty but mellow choice in the Tully's lineup.  We especially like the 50 pack convenience.  Jet Fuel is also great.<a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B006HPGVPK">Delightful Short Stories Little Romances</a>,5
These cookies are awesome.  Great for dieters and those cutting out sugar.  So good!  You won't miss your old Oreos at all.,5
Good reviews and my Maltese loves it!  We buy and switch up all the flavors.  I usually mix with their dry small bites (also very good).,5
This is the smoothest dark roast coffee I have ever had! I have tried all of the coffee offered by Ahh cupella coffee and most of their teas. Always a treat!,5
"Look, I love chips and hate the idea of having to give them up because they are no good for me...these ROCK and are not detrimental. Taste great and a FULL bag are around 300 calories...cannot beat it...these are an integral part of my having dropped 30 lbs in the past 2 1/2 mos...",5
"When I first started to buy VitaGravy, my dogs loved it. After a few weeks, they don't seem to care too much for it anymore. They still get it in their kibble every day, and will eventually eat it when they are hungry, but they don't consider it to be a treat anymore. I still buy it because of its beneficial nutritional value and decent price compared to a pill vitamin supplement. One big negative I have noticed about it is that their face is getting dirty from it. They are white dogs and this product tends to cause increased tear and around-the-mouth stains. I used to buy all different flavors of VitaGravy, buy my groomer told me the chicken flavor is best as the beef and pork based flavors can cause an even worse increase in face staining.",3
"We give Comice pears to our elderly Aunts each year but two years ago the company we bought from was bought out & the quality really tanked.  I've been looking for another source.  This year I tried these people & WOW, really, really good.  Hope they are still on Amazon next Christmas.",5
"My four year old Beagle's coat has improved by switching from Pedigree to Rachael Ray. His stool is much firmer now which should help reduce discomfort from impacted anal glands (I also give him ground organic flax seed as a supplement).<br /><br />By comparison, the primary ingredient in Pedigree is corn. With Rachael Ray, the primary ingredients are chicken and rice. It still contains some corn and animal fat but its further down on the list of ingredients. You can tell the difference in quality when you first open the bag -- it smells like proper food. Cheap dog foods tend to stink up the room.<br /><br />I even sampled a few kibbles for myself and found them to be reasonably tasty, like a snack food.<br /><br />I gave it four stars rather than five because it contains cheaper filler grains like corn meal and brewers rice. Among low-cost dog foods, this is arguably the best available option.",4

The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS).

Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women.

It doesn't last the 3 months I thought it would, so now getting an order about once a month. 1 oz of this is 3 Weight Watcher's points, so when I feel like I need a sweet, it's more than one mouthful, it's a whole handful. I am sure I would LOVE the other varieties, but probably more points, so will stick with this for now...if my husband doesn't eat it all.",5

"I was at the Mother Earth News Fair a few weeks back and was given a sample of this cat food.  Now, I have cough*five*cough cats.  (It's a long story, they're not really all mine, and one just showed up, and... whatever.  I like cats.  Shut up.)  My cats range from a twenty year-old (seriously) with kidney problems and a prescription diet, to a one year-old who'll try to eat anything she comes across.  I usually feed them all (except for the ill elder) a mix of Science Diet and Purina, which works well at keeping everyone's digestive systems going properly, and supplement with a once daily scoop of wet food.<br /><br />When I brought home the Solid Gold Indigo Moon, I fed them the sample like I would treats - a little sprinkle for each cat.  They all loved it, and we literally went through the sample - fed as treats - within a few days, each of them begging and doing their aren't-I-adorable act to try to get more.<br /><br />With five cats, $30/bag cat food is a pretty hefty investment to make.  Even if they really like it.  But, I was swayed by the nutritional information, and I figured I could try to incorporate Indigo Moon into their diets without committing to an all-or-nothing plan since my cats took to the food as a treat already.  As a bonus, by not switching them off their usual diet, merely ""supplementing"" with a spoon-sized scoop or two of Indigo Moon for their morning and nightly treats, they haven't had the digestive issues a food change can bring out in them.  The Solid Gold is a lot healthier than the old treats they were getting, and they seem to be just as, if not more, eager to eat it up.<br /><br />Ultimately, I highly recommend Solid Gold Indigo Moon Cat Food.  Even if it's too expensive to use as your cat's primary food, consider using it as a supplement or daily treat - it's both cheaper than typical treats, ounce for ounce, and far healthier - and who knows, it may go over even better than typical treats usually do.",4

I have a cavalier that will not do anything without a treat.  Not sure how I let him get this way but there it is.  He also seems to need to chew things much longer than my others.  With these he takes the treat and does not take "forever" to chew it.  I will continue to purchase these as I've found nothing else to work as well AND they are made in the USA - very important for me.,5
"My German inlaws give us stollen every year to enjoy on Christmas Eve.  This year they sent us this brand. Sugar coating for some reason tasted like flour and didn't even have a hint of sweetness. I had to thow it out.  The second loaf wasn't as bad, but sugar coating still did not seem right.  It had sweetness, but didn't melt in your mouth right. Still tasted like it was mostly flour.  Maybe they got sugar and flour mixed up. Inside was good: moist with plenty of marzipan filling.",1
"Popchips are delicious!!!  We bought a variety pack.  I love the Salt & Pepper though all flavors are good (according to my husband since I can't have any dairy I did not try those flavors).  While the chips are high in sodium, they are a nice healthy alternative to grease and salt laden fried potato chips.  Don't expect a traditional potato chip or even a pressed chip like Pringles.  They are different but delicious.  A 0.8 ounce bag contains only 100 calories and 10% of your daily salt (2000 cal diet).  The bag says they start with a potato and ""add a little heat and pressure and.. pop.""  Well, not quite.  The ingredients list: Natural Potato Ingredients (Potato Flakes, Potato Starch), Safflower Oil and/or Sunflower Oil, Rice Flour, Sea Salt.  If you need gluten-free, they are gluten free BUT they are made on equipment shared with wheat.",5
"This is a very flavorful blend.  I thought it would be bitter when I saw how dark it was, but it is not bitter, but has a robust, smooth flavor and aroma.  I love the fact that it is fair traded and organic.  Good bargain.",5
"If you are used to the dark brown, coarse ground flaxseed, do yourself a favor and try this golden flax.  Wonderful!!!  I got it a week ago and have already tried it in smoothies, bread, muffins and oatmeal.  It is very finely ground, which makes it all but disappear.  Much better than what I was eating before!  And the value was far greater than the grocery store.  Highly recommend!",5
Remember the old creamers when you were a kid? (only baby boomers will remember this). We used to eat the powered creamer by the spoon becasue it was so good. And then researchers mistakenly said that "dairy" was bad for the heart and everything went to chemicals? The new chemical creamers are yucky--but if you want to return to the good old days--this is it!!!,5
"My kids like this cocoa, but I find flavor less delicious than the more expensive <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B003VQXYMQ"">Green Mountain Coffee Hot Cocoa, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers (Pack of 2)</a>.",3
This stuff was awful. It tasted like water soaked in Cherios-except the Cherios had a better flavor. This mud had no coffee aroma or flavor! My stomach was still aching so I really dont know how low acid or decaf this sewage was. As an unexpected bonus I also got a terrible headache.What a bunch of crap!,1
"I'm new to green tea so I purchased this product with Bigelow Green Tea, Preferred tea is Bigelow without any doubt but that's my personal preference.",3
"My husband and I have been ordering this coffee for over a year.  Amazon still seems to be the cheapest even though we have had a few price increases which have resulted in approx $7 per box since we first ordered.  The coffee is very good if you like flavored coffee.  Very rich with flavor and is med bold.  Smells delectable when brewing.  We are totally addicted to our Keurig coffee maker.  We have tried several brands and flavors of coffee but this one remains at the top of our list. Thank you Amazon for carrying it, the auto shipping and for such great service.",5
"I have been trying to find a good brand of jerky that I don't have to order online.  I finally tried Jack Link's original.  Way too sweet, doesn't taste like meat, and most of the pieces don't have the texture of meat.  At times, I thought I was eating plastic.  Or some soy meat-substitute.  I couldn't even make it through the whole bag.  I miss the original Pemmican..., before ConAgra sold the brand and it got ruined...",1
These are great for a mid afternoon snack.  I like some flavors better than others but that's ok.,5
"Okay, I am hooked on this stuff! They did an absolutely fantastic job of replicating traditional jerky texture and taste (but without the meat and all the MSG and preservatives). It is so tasty and healthy and you can literally eat it anytime...before workouts, or as a really healthy snack for me and the kids. The Hot N' Spicy and Ginger are my favorite flavours. I would like them to create a Spicy Ginger..yum! I would like to see greater availability, perhaps through local supermarkets, Trader Joes, and maybe even Costco/Sams Club (if their production would permit). The world needs more healthful tasty eats like these!",5
"Dogs love these treats more than any other treats I've ever found.  In situations where other treats fail to get our dog's attention - <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0019O5Z0Q"">Charlee Bear Turkey Liver & Cranberry Flavored Dog Treats</a>, for example - these treats are impossible for her to ignore.  They are an incredible training aid.<br /><br />Big bonus is that they're also simple and good for the dog.  Liver is a healthy treat and is supposed to help combat weepy eyes.  Unlike most other commercial treats, this one isn't loaded with a bunch of other junk that isn't good for your dog (byproducts and the like), it's just a good ingredient that your dog will love.",5
"I was one who never cared for tomato soup. But I was at my daughter's house and she was feeding this as lunch with sandwiches to her husband's sons. I looked in the pot- thought it was interesting to see chunks of tomatoes in tomato soup. I tried a spoonful. I sipped the edge of the spoon. I emptied the pot!! I am hooked on this! The best soup ever, ever. I have it all the time now. You will not regret this- try it, you'll like it for real.",5
"I bought these about a month ago because we have a few cats that we occasionally have to give pills.  It worked for 2 of the cats but the other seemed to sense that something was ""fishy"" about these things and wouldn't touch them.  But for the other two cats they worked great.<br /><br />They are like a semi-moist cat food, but more moist and pliable.  There's a little indentation in the middle and you just push the pill inside and squeeze it together.  The cats seem to pretty much swallow it whole, or if they do chew it, don't notice the pill inside.  If it were a very  bitter pill I probably wouldn't use these since they'd probably be able to taste it.  Anything that gets medication down even 2 of the cats without a struggle is a success as far as I'm concerned.",5
"This is my favorite brand and flavor.  I know it's a popular one, which is why I thought it was weird that my local stores had stopped carrying the 3 pack versions.<br /><br />Finally decided to bite the bullet and bulk order.  Glad I did, as it's great to have this many packs at my disposal.",5
I am very pleased with the Stash tea I purchased.  It was a VERY good deal & the quality is excellent,5
We used to have drive down to the specialty pet food store for this product.  So glad we discovered Amazon.  As far as I can tell it is no more expensive & in some cases less - Prime membership is awesome.  Loving Pets treats are some of the best according to my dog.  They do not develop that nasty smell like some dog treats do.,5
My dog is sick and on prednisone.  The vet recommended this food because of weight gain from the prednisone.  My Yorkie Loved it! I was really surprised.  He eats every bite.  It's really tiny pieces so its easy for a tiny dog to eat.  I mixed a bit of his old food with it at first and gradually lower the amount of his older food.  Now he is just eating this food. That way there's no stomach upset from drastically changing his diet. I would definitely recommend this food for weight loss and it was neurology vet approved.,5
"I bought this because I am on Weight Watchers and didn't want to give up PB. Only 1 WW point per Tblsp. I love the roasted, fresh taste.  There isn't anything funky tasting at all. It's just roasted peanut powder and a very small amount of salt & sugar. You just mix it with a little water.<br />It would be really good mixed with honey but I eat it with apple slices.",5
"I used to live in Malaysia and am always looking for dishes to replicate the amazing food I had in KL. This beef rendang has great flavor - that's for sure.<br />I only gave it 4 stars because I found it overly sweet and a little too mild in heat.  Plus, there were hard bits of leaves that were somewhat distracting.<br /><br />I wonder....would using a can of coconut milk cut the sweetness?<br /><br />But....the flavor was so good and the preparation was so darn easy, that I'm ordering more boxes to have on hand.<br /><br />And yes - I would serve this at Supper Club . I just wouldn't tell anyone how easy it was to make!<br /><br />I wonder....would using a can of coconut milk cut the sweetness?",4
"I just recently got a Keurig coffee maker & registered it online.  Keurig sent me a coupon for buy 2 boxes, get 2 free.  Awhile back, a local bagel shop had a coconut coffee that I fell in love with.  So, I decided to try this coffee out because it has coconut in it.  I brewed my first cup this morning & it smelled VERY strong of coconut so of COURSE I couldn't wait to try it.  After it cooled down a bit I took my first sip.  AMAZING!!  It is quite delightful & I STRONGLY recommend it if you like coconut coffee.  No bitter aftertaste, either & no soot @ the bottom of my cup.  Awesome",5
Quick delivery and product exactly as advertised. Product in original packaging. Price much lower than retail stores. Small size treats great for smaller dogs.  Thanks.,5
Got at a great price.  A little slow (backordered) but worth the wait (savings).  Other than the UPS man using this as a booster seat along the way - all is good otherwise.,5
"I would have preferred some dark chocolate with my nutmeg bar.<br /><br />It was unpalatable. I had to hold my nostrils together to get it down. I had 2 other people try it and they didn't like it either.<br /><br />I can see one person here reviewing loves is, which is great, at least someone does. But, I thought it was terrible. If I had a crazy sweet tooth and it was the only chocolate around, I still wouldn't eat it.",1
"First of all, I do agree with the above reviewers who thought this wasn't a great fruit dip. Second, there's very little marshmallow flavor-this stuff is NOTHING like regular marshmallow fluff.<br /><br />However, I still give this 5 stars, because it's got features you can't get anywhere else. The texture is smooth pudding (Grainy reviewer perhaps ate his past the expiration date?) and that's mainly how I use this. Because of the slightly sharp taste of the cellulose, this dip lends itself very well to making citrus puddings (just add about 1/4 cup lemon concentrate and stir, doesn't get any easier than that). I also use it to make cheesecake and other dessert recipes.<br /><br />To actually make a good fruit dip out of this, try mixing it with yogurt or cream cheese.",5
"The tree is beautiful but upon arrival when I opened the carton some of the dirt and pebbles were scattered around in the box. Also, no humidity tray was included - the last place I purchased from online included that with a bag of pebbles to put in it.",4
"(mind you, this is my mom's account..)<br /><br />I bought this drink awhile ago, and I like it alot! (mind you, I don't drink energy drinks often. but I HAD to try this one!)<br /><br />the liquid inside the can is a light green, kind of like mountain dew. (I was expecting it to be red or purple..)<br />also, it tastes kind of like green apple!! (not sour apples, sweet actually.)<br />I think that that's the cool part about the drink, I've never drank a soda that tasted like green apples before!<br /><br />the drink is pretty sweet tasting, it's not very harsh..<br />the best part, it's not too fizzy. lot's of energy drinks have a heavy fizz to them, which kills the taste of the drink.<br /><br />however be forewarned...<br /><br />this IS an energy drink, to me-I didn't feel a buzz or energetic. quite the opposite.<br />it did give me a bit of a headache, and it made my stomach do a total flip-flop! also, I felt kinda tired after drinking it...<br /><br />if you decide to buy this drink, keep this in mind: it's powerfully choc-full of caffeine (but I didn't feel the effects),<br />and sugar, and I reccomend that you drink small sips of it at a time instead of chugging it!<br />however, it IS really sweet and tasty..and the can is just SO COOL~! even if you bought this drink, you could just collect<br />the can and add it to a collection~! (I still have the can, I could never throw it away!)<br /><br />so yeah, I give this drink a 4/5...it was really good, but it did make me feel weird.<br /><br />*pro's*<br />-cool can artwork (feel free to just collect the can~!)<br />-sweet green apple taste (also kinda cool that it has a green color too!)<br />-not too much of a buzz or burst of energy (if you're a caffeine addict, you might be disappointed!)<br /><br />*cons*<br />-you may feel strange effects after drinking (or, maybe you won't)<br />-FULL of caffeine and sugar (parents, be mindful of this product and it's possible affects on your younger children!)<br /><br />I hope this review was helpful to someone, it needed a review afterall~!

"Ok, sounds crazy i know but i heard about this baby food diet and figured whats there to loose. The food tastes good, and im sure your baby will like it too hahaha!",5
"People, learn how to read nutrition labels. Servings are typically divided into just one or two cookies. Two cookies contain about 100 calories, 24 g carbohydrates and 14 g sugars. The calorie breakdown is over 90% carbohydrates, mostly from sugars. This is a BIG red flag. No one should consume junk like this. Don't be misled by the ""Fat Free"" label. (see second paragraph) Refined sugars are far, far worse for dieters than fats are; poly- and monounsaturated fats are in fact beneficial, and calories from fat provide more stable energy. With the exception of trans and saturated fats, (they raise bad cholesterol) you really shouldn't be on a low-fat diet. Sugars are the worst thing for dieters, as they aren't as likely to be metabolized as energy, and will typically be stored as body fat. (mostly around the mid-section) High-fructose corn syrup (an ingredient in SnackWell's products) is specifically linked with an increased risk of obesity and diabetes. The human body simply is not meant to metabolize this much sugar, nor sugars that are unnaturally processed. I can't provide links to research on the subject, because Amazon has rather ridiculous policies that censor URLs, names of other sites, stores, competitors, etc. from reviews. Be sure to complain to Amazon.com about this practice. Still, it's easy enough to open a search engine and type ""snackwell devil food nutrition facts"" or the like.<br /><br />Bear in mind that products are not required to declare nutritional content when the servings are divided into small portions, and the content would be less than 0.5 g. Each cookie actually contains 0.17 g saturated fat, which Nabisco neglects to mention. Trans fat content is entirely unaccounted for, though it may actually exist. This means that ""Fat Free"" claim was just a blatant lie. Will anyone hold Nabisco responsible for unscrupulously deceiving consumers, though? Can anyone demand that they pull misleading products off the shelf? Nope. Welcome to corporate America.<br /><br />Don't let Nabisco and other ""health-conscience"" snack companies scam you. Read labels closely, and be suspicious of small servings. If a single serving contains less than 0.5 g trans fat, then it doesn't have to be declared; the label will inaccurately specify 0 g. If the portions seem ridiculously small, then it's safe to assume they're trying to hide something from the consumer.<br /><br />On a side note, please ignore ""helpful review"" ratings. Re-distributors of products will often vote down critical reviews, because they demote the very products they're trying to sell on Amazon. It's all politics.",1
"Do you know those Tootsie Pop commercials where they'd see how many times the Tootsie Pop could be licked before they'd chew right into it?  That's how this Likety Stik worked with my dog.  He licked it three or four times, then immediately wanted to chew on the roller.  I repeatedly pulled it out each time he'd try, but it kept repeating.  Lick, lick, lick, chew.  Lick, lick, lick chew.  Within one minute, no exaggerating, he had chewed off the end and I was scared to death that he'd swallow the roll ball. Fortunately he spit it out, but if he had swallowed it, he easily could have choked to death on it with it blocking his windpipe.  I would never buy this product again, and highly recommend others not to.  Seriously, it was completely chewed through in one minute of opening the package.",1
"I've a difficult time drinking red raspberry leaf tea in the past. I wanted to try it again during my second pregnancy for uterine health. This time I steeped it in boiling water, added lots of honey, and poured it over ice. It's still not the best tasting tea variety, but this particular brand seems a bit more palletable than some others. As far as it's potency/effectiveness, I suppose I won't know until the baby comes (although realistically I'm not sure I'll even know then).<br /><br />This price is amazing, too. I kicked myself for paying twice as much at a local health food store. I will definitely be buying my next box here instead.",5
I was very happy with the quick shipping as i needed it for a school product for my daughter but when it came in the roof was broken and the corner of the house was broken. I couldn't send it back as i needed for a project.,3
I ordered these as a gift. They are my friend favorite and they are hard to find. A little pricy but no one else sells,5
My mom bought this for me over the holidays.  I was so excited to use it as I wanted to try making my own organic baby food at home.  Being a busy professional I never imagined it would be this easy.  I love the all in one concept.  The only thing I wasn't happy about was that it cost $150 but was made in China.  I would have preferred for it to be made in France as I'm sure it used to be a few years ago.  Another thing:  I had a lot of trouble figuring out how to secure the blade when I first opened it.  The instruction book wasn't very descriptive about it except for a small picture.  A phone call to the company finally resolved the issue.,5
"I always buy this popcorn for my dad who has a neighborhood group, and often sponsors boxing matches and other get togethers. He has a 6 ounce popper and he swears by this popcorn, "" so easy"" he says, and the people love it. So if you have a 6 ounce popper, GET THIS POPCORN!!!!",5
"My local grocery store didn't carry it anymore and due to the large amounts of coffee I drink, I like to detox from time to time using this tea. The hibiscus is great for your kidneys.<br />The flavor is great hot or cold. If you are wondering what this tastes like, if you have tried Starbucks' ""Berry Berry Hibiscus"" drink and liked it then you will like this also as the flavor is quite similar. The price is very reasonable, it cost the same as the grocery store including shipping.<br /><br />Definitely will continue to purchase here @ Amazon!",5
"I hate to admit it, but I actually taste new dry dog food brands before giving any to my pooches.  You wouldn't believe how awful some dog food really is.  I knew Chef Michael's was a winner from the get-go.  The dogs just love it, and I feel good knowing it's loaded with vitamins/minerals, and the primary ingredient is either beef (grilled sirloin flavor) or chicken (oven roasted chicken).  Unlike some dog food, Chef Michael's isn't overly-sweet or heavily laden with corn.  My older dog is finicky and has a little trouble chewing, but she can easily (and readily) eat this.  It's a blend of soft pieces and smaller kibble.  Mixing with a little water helps even more.<br /><br />My one complaint is expense.  Dog food prices, particularly better quality brands, have skyrocketed.  I refuse to buy junk, so must take advantage of sales and coupons.  I often wonder what the actual cost to make dog food products really is.  Ten dollars for a 4.5 lb bag of dog food seems extravagant.",4
"This is the best nacho cheese, and tastes great with chicken & beef! It's got a slight heat to it, but still mild enough that my kids will eat it. It's become impossible to find in AZ, so I was thrilled to find it on Amazon. The price is almost as good as I used to pay for it in stores. Definitely recommend!",5
"This is the best Margarita mix I've ever had.  The best part is the 0 calories and lack of guilt.  Because I don't use alcohol, the consistency in the blender is a bit lumpy but still good.  With alcohol, it blends very smoothly!",5
I find the crisps dissolve in your mouth and aren't especially filling.  It's pretty tasty and an unbelievable 40 calories per pack.  But I think I'll stick to regular apples as more filling and tastier.,2
"I agree with some of the other reviewers (for the NON-Classic syrup). I have been buying this product, mostly to add to coffee, for several years. At some point, I noticed that the flavor changed, and (to my palate at least), it was a change for the worse. After noticing some of the recent reviews, I made sure to order the ""Classic"" flavor when my supply started to run low. When it arrived, I taste-tested vs. the ""non-Classic"" syrup that I still had on hand, and (again, to my palate), the ""Classic"" tasted far superior. I suppose other people may prefer the new flavor, but for me, the Classic is the one I'll order from now on.",5
"Reviewing dog biscuits is a little difficult. Did my golden retriever eat the biscuits? Yes, quite readily.  Did her teeth and breath get noticeably cleaner? Perhaps, but having only tried one box--which lasted a couple of weeks--I am not sure I can guarantee such a result.  Like all dog treats, they seem to recommend a lot per day.",3
My Akita has to be switched from food to food constantly. He gets bored fat. The trick is to get high quality dry and canned food that doesn't make him sick. He's not sensitive perse...there have been only a few dog foods that affected him adversely. This food is not one of them. He wolfs it right down every time we feed it to him. I'm buying more as I type.,5
"Expensive, but there is a good reason, it's taste is beyond wonderful. Wish I had never taseted it :) !",5
"I have tried a couple flavors of this, Pomegranate is my favorite, and I think they work great! I have a busy 3 year old and work full time, so there are times I need an extra boost.  I have tried other energy drinks and always feel anxious and jittery.  I didn't get that with 5 Hour Energy.  I felt a noticeable boost in energy about 10 minutes after drinking it and it tapered off throughout the day, I never had the crash I was expecting. I wouldn't use these everyday, but for when you need the extra boost, it's perfect!<br /><br />I received a free sample of 5-Hour ENERGY® from Smiley360.",4
I am a tea drinker and a chocolate lover.  This tea is decaf and has a very chocolatey taste.  It satisfied my craving for chocolate without any calories.  I love it and so does the rest of my family.,5
"This might be better as an ice cream topping than as a cereal. The nutritional content of this is pretty poor, it's very sweet, and really not all that nutty.  the protein of the nuts doesn't even register in the nutrition. You're better off with Honey Nut Cheerios, IMO.  This is just another spin-off of the other sugared, flake cereals.",2

"This tea is for urinary health.  It definitely helps relieve pain.  If you have an UTI, this tea does not cure it, but it helps in relieving pain in the urethra.  The taste is not the greatest, but it's a medicine tea, so I don't mind, knowing that I will find relief.  You need to steep the tea for a half hour and then drink it while its still hot and fresh.  Use a few times a day.  This tea is from Croatia... a place where they have wonderful herbs for medicinal teas.",5
"this is the second time I have ordered these from the same seller (Amazon as it gives free shipping). The first time the slim jims were moist and plump and oily and you could tell they were fresh. This second batch was hard and dried out and not oily at all. For those who like slim jims you know what I mean about them being plump and oily as opposed to hard and dried out without much oil.<br /><br />This is the ONLY place I can get the HOT ones so I was dissappointed with the second batch, while the first batch was perfect! I will continue to buy these but may see baout buying from a different seller to get fresher ones.",3
"I have been talked into buying this by my one dog...I had recklessly given him a sample, not realizing it would alter his taste buds and make him REFUSE anything else (except of course human grade food). So he gets it and is very happy to eat it plain or lightly adorned with a canned dog food.<br />It's breaking my budget but better than breaking my heart which is what happens when my dog doesn't eat.",5

"I have never heard of this brand but I'm glad I tried it. I've always drank Tazo Chai, so this is what I'm going to compare the higgins & Burke Chai to. When you take the Tazo and the H&B tea sachets out of the wrappers, both have a wonderfully spcy chai aroma. The difference is in the brewing. I didn't expect to prefer the Higgins & Burke over Tazo but I DO!!! It brews a nice ""red"" colored spicy cup of chai. No bitterness but the aroma and flavor is just as rich. It does not matter now long you leave the tea bag in your cup. On the contrary, the Tazo will become very dark and bitter. The bitter tea flavor of an oversteeped cup of chai masks the spices. I think I'm converting to H&B becuase the flavor is great. And no matter how long you steep you just can't go wrong with this blend. Every cup is delicious!!! I recommend you get some :) It comes in a pack of 6, but if you love it like I do, it won't last too long. Or you can share. Your co-workers are bound to ask to bum sum off you when they try it.",5
"These red beans are excellent.  I grew up in Louisiana near New Orleans and occasionally cook my own red beans -- these are every bit as good and a whole lot quicker.

Serve over rice for a delicious, quick and easy meal.  Big thumbs up!",5
"Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup Grade B, 32-Ounce Jug:<br /><br />I remember when my grandmother would make pancakes, waffles or potato pancakes and the maple syrup was just so delightful to the taste. She would warm it up on the old gas stove.  You'd think that all of the major brands of ""pancake syrup maple flavored,"" would stop using high fructose corn syrup.<br /><br />One day last week I had the chance to take my granddaughter out grocery shopping with me.  Not one of my best things to do, but I thought, how would she learn to shop and look for the good stuff, not the crap that's advertised on television, but the products that really work and the one's that are good for you.  Reading the labels is a major chore as what you thought was in the product wasn't even close to being in the product. Somebody has to teach her and it was my lucky day.<br /><br />Take for example, pancake syrup or what used to be called maple syrup in my day.  You look at the labels, today... never is there mention of a maple tree, not even close, all fructose or high fructose corn syrup.  So, I told her that maple syrup comes from sugar maple tree sap that has the water content reduced and I asked her if she could find a reference to a maple tree in the contents.  Well, you know the answer, there isn't any on the major or store brands.<br /><br />I told her that Coombs makes a maple syrup that reminded me of when I was growing up.  Well, after a few grocery stores later and checking their stock we came across the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup.<br /><br />Now, I know, I've been telling my granddaughter about how I grew up, so she wasn't going to let me off the hook so easily.  You guessed it... I made pancakes and we used the Coombs Family Farms Maple Syrup, warmed up on the stove just like grandma did.  She said, ""That's the best Maple Syrup I've ever tasted.""  I told her that's because it's real maple syrup.<br /><br />A lesson learned, and I was pleased to make pancakes for my granddaughter, this is one of those moments you don't forget in life.",5

"Received the product without delay and undamaged. The product's plastic container is very well constructed and the wide mouth opening is very convenient. I found the coconut oil to be of excellent quality as far as I can perceive, though I am not an expert. The flavor is excellent. Good price.",5
"I'm a huge fan of Vitafusion products because they taste good and make taking vitamins really easy, if not, enjoyable--it's almost like eating candy without the guilt. The only draw back is potentially eating too much of it, so I would keep it away from children. Like other fiber products, eating excess can cause gas or upset stomach. There is also a regular version that is not sugar free, so if you are not too concerned about sugar, you have that option too. Personally the sugar free and regular versions taste pretty similar so no big deal either way. Overall, a good buy especially if you want to increase your fiber intake without the hassle or unappetizing of traditional powders, pills, and drinks.",5
"I admit that for many years I only liked the ""bad"" stuff in the grocery store that was chock full of high fructose corn syrup and didn't have maple syrup in it!  I just liked the flavor.  Other maple syrups (which were Grade A) just tasted watery to me and didn't have that rich flavor I wanted.<br /><br />But since we're trying to eat healthier now and getting rid of stuff with HFCS in it I wanted to find a syrup that tasted really good.  And I've found it!<br /><br />This syrup is really flavorful, dark in color, and very rich.  I just absolutely love it.  Never again will I go back to using the fake stuff when the real stuff is so incredibly tasty - not to mention better for you!  Thanks Coombs Family Farms for making this.  It's fantastic!",5
"I eat a lot of granola cereal. This is one of the better ones. i like having it delivered, but I'm not sure that I'm saving any money. Now with having to pay sales tax in Texas, it will not be worth it.  But, it is very tasty.  4 stars because of cost, not quality",4
"This Head & shoulders shampoo really controls my dry itchy scalp! It does have a heavy scent tho. I'd buy it again because my hair stays clean a lot longer, too. I recommend that you buy it!",5
These  same nuts are available at costco for 9.99.  They are delicious and the only reason I have a membership.  Am I missing something?,4
These are so good! Very crispy and surprisingly sweet for only 5 grams of sugar. Finally a cold cereal for a gluten and corn free diet that actually has fiber in it!,5
"I have been into dates since moving to Palm Desert in the 1980's. I fell in love with the medjools which are the softest, sweetest, at lest from the desert. These are every bit as good and very soft and sweet, and dates are so very nutritious. I recommnend them highly. They also have a lot of potassium and about double or more of that in bananas for folks on diuretics. They're simply a wonderful food. The seeds grow nicely  into little palm trees. Dates are God's gift to man in the desert.",5
"My mother-in-law recommended this stuff as we passed by it in costco and cause we were on a random bordom shopping trip, I bought it. So we got it home and I didn't even look at it for like a week. Then thinking that it was like some kind of sugary syrup I tried some right out of the bottle. It was simultaneously the worst thing I'd ever tasted and the best thing. My husband fully agrees with that statement by the way, so spare yourself the pain and don't eat this straight. So because of this I thought it was a total bust.  Well, I was making coffee a couple days later and we had no sugar or milk so just so I wasn't drinking my coffee black I put some of the Agave sweetener in there thinking it would taste better than it being black, but still crappy as hell. I was amazed when it tasted awesome. Now, I must say that I am the kind of person that can only stomach coffee when it is about 70 percent milk and sugar... I actually have tried my coffee half sugar and half coffee before... I still didn't like it too much. So for me to say that it made my coffee taste awesome is a big deal, a really big deal. I, uh, haven't tried it in anything else yet. I will, update when I screw up the courage to do so... :)",3
SLIMSTIX IS THE BEST MARGARITA MIX EVER!!!! The mix is awesome because there is no nasty sour mix or other added ingredients and you are only getting the calories of the alcohol.,5
"We make this great, tasty bread two or three times a week. It's great for sandwiches -- especially grilled cheese. We also make braided loaves baked free-form to serve as ""pull apart"" bread to serve with soup and salad. However, a tip if you don't use a bread machine. We add a tablespoon of honey and a teaspoon of sugar to the water to proof the yeast then add a teaspoon of regular, not fast-rise, yeast to that provided with the mix. This seems to work better using a KitchenAid to mix and kneed the bread. Bake as directed. The extra east seems to withstand the longer rising time required when using an oven to bake the loaf.",5
"We try to use olive oil for as many purposes as possible because of the health benefits.  The best olive oils are first pressed/cold pressed because there is less processing involved and the oil has higher levels of the good stuff, plus it is generally of a lighter nature with a less pungent taste.<br /><br />The latter is particularly important when you are cooking for picky little kids.  And it's one of the reasons we use Bertolli's extra-light.  This extra-light oil is nearly tasteless.  HOW TASTELESS?  I use it all the time in cake recipes.  It absolutely makes no difference to the taste.<br /><br />Pam T",5
"First, I have to say my cat loves the Fussie Cat foods. She has a malabsorption problem and switching to Fussie Cat has really helped with the throwing up and loose stools. We've tried almost every variety and am impressed with the quality; hence the 4-star rating. Being able to get this brand with subscribe and save rocks and it saves me a lot of money.<br /><br />My one complaint is that the Tuna with Shrimp case just came and was full of dented, slightly damaged cans. None of the cans have broken open or been punctured, but the dents aren't minor and since these are sold as 'new' I shouldn't be receiving dented cans. Hopefully this is just a one off occurrence.",4
"I am celiac and have been keeping a strictly gluten-free diet for over six years, and was excited to learn about this product.  After eating it, [the taste and texture was not bad] I became sick in the way that I always do when ingesting gluten. Nana's also makes non-gluten products, and clearly are not careful about cross-contamination.  If you are concerned about ingesting gluten or keeping a strictly celiac diet, I strongly recommend you avoid this product.  I also think that the company should not deceive their customers, many who suffer from celiac disease, and should more clearly label their product as it is a danger to the health of many who would be inclined to buy this product.",1
"I bought this as a subscription for my daughter's cats, as our own cats like this.  Two of the three of my daughter's ones won't touch it, very strange, they are too fussy !",4
"once it gets here, very good taste and condition, except now i check the web and find northeast and a few others considerably less expensive same amount; i also had a problem with the shipping- from them cross country to upstate ny; they send an email saying 4-8 days, but elapsed from when ordered to delivery (tracking said ""on time"") was 11 days- to get a small package to the east coast? not what they said; surf for a better deal",2
My dog likes this product.  That is most important.  It doesn't have a foul odor...  The description says you can break it in pieces... you can but it is a bit dry and pieces don't come off in the same size consistently.  Overall I would recommend.,4
"Our kids really like this mac-n-cheese!  I cut up hot dogs into ""pucks"" and mix it in.  The sauce is creamy and it's very easy to make.  I like that the box is recyclable, too!  And with 12 to a box, we won't run out for a while!",5
"I usually don't write reviews, but this is such a great tasting tea I felt compelled to post. It is by far the best tasting green tea I've ever had. It has a very refreshing citrus flavor.",5
"I love this cat food because there are no artificial ingredients or by products.  My cat has food allergies (his skin gets itchy and he bites all his fur off) so this is one of the few canned cat foods that he can eat.  While being on a strict diet, it took about two months for his fur to grow back, and he was happy again.  I recommend this cat food to any cat with skin allergies.  And my cat loves it!",5
"If you want a truly healthy, filling snack, you must give these a try, as well as their sisters, the Vanilla Bean Almonds. They are both just lightly sweetened, and fragrant with either the cinnamon or the vanilla, depending on which you choose. The container is marvelous; there is a half flip top which is easy to do with one hand (like in the car). And they're not roasted in more oil, so the almonds are ""meaty"" and sweet. And almonds are SOOO good for you. I'd recommend that you try them, and then get an Amazon subscribe and save if you can. It's well worth it! And all natural. LOVELY!",5
"Several years ago my first Maine Coon cat found me.  It's true what is said about these cats - you can't have just one!  Now I have three  ^..^  My first MC came to me with a gum infection and lots of dental plaque at only 9 months of age.  This was when I discovered Royal Canin cat food specifically designed for large breed cats with larger muzzle and jaws.  They eat food differently than smaller cats and need the large kibble to slow ingestion and encourage thorough chewing.  Now everyone has clean teeth and we've never had another dental bill.  The extra ingredients for joint support (glucosamine) and coat (salmon oil) are wonderful, and my cats are thriving on this dry formula.  I also feed a partial raw diet and always offer plenty of kitty greens.<br /><br />All large cats can benefit from this formula:  Norwegian Forest Cats, MC mix and any cat with a large muzzle and dental problems.  Thank you, Royal Canin and Amazon for bringing this to us at a great price.  Note to Amazon:  would be great to have this in the frequent flyer auto-ship option.",5
a great deal. it arrived with no damage. the taste to me is the best. i have tried most other brands and really got fed up with them. they just don't taste right to me. but this one i can eat right out of the bottle and enjoy it. it tastes so good. i am very happy with this purchase and the price is great also.,5
"I wasn't sure what to expected with these bars. I am not a huge energy bar fan. I find them too heavy and even after spending eight hours of hiking, I can only eat half of an energy bar. I admit, that I was expected the same thing with these. Instead, I got a light and almost cookie like bar that was delicious. I would have never guessed that they were gluten free because I've tried gluten free food and this was nothing like that. This bar was a perfect afternoon snack that was chewy and light. I really enjoyed the nice sweet flavor that wasn't overpowering. I had eaten the entire bar before I knew it and found it kept me going all afternoon too. I think I might have found a new hiking snack! Yay!",4
I have a small dog that needs 1/2 pill daily.  It had been a constant battle to get her to take her medication. Half the time she managed to spit out the pill even though I put it down her throat.  With Greenies Pill Pockets she eagerly take her pill. This products works exactly as advertised.,5
"This coffee is the worst I've ever tasted!  I like strong, but this was very bitter!  Stick with the kona blend and Nantucket blend, or even breakfast blend.",1
"We go backpacking and camping a lot.  This snack is perfect for those types of activities because it takes the edge off hunger, provides much needed calories (each bag has 310 calories), and is spicy enough to give that little extra ""kick"" just when you need it.  If you don't lead an active lifestyle, you may want to consider snacks with a lower calorie count.  If you are constantly on the go, however, this snack will help get you from meal to meal.",5
"This illy issimo Cappucino Coffee Drink is very nice served over ice! The coffee flavor is not very strong but it is nicely sweet and packs a good caffeine (81 mg) kick, making this a refreshing ""pick me up"" on a hot afternoon. My coffee loving daughter absolutely loved it as well.<br /><br />Highly Recommended!<br /><br />CFH",5
"I wouldn't buy this product again, it isn't bad chocolate, but it isn't great chocolate either.  Truthfully, Hershey's tastes much better.  The box is neat, so, if you're looking for a new type of gift for someone, then it is worth a try because it is German chocolate, especially for a child.  A child would enjoy this.  A chocolate lover would rather have Wockenfuss chocolates.",3
"The taste of this baby food isn't bad, and my baby likes to eat it. I wonder am I not getting the freshest shipment or this product just has a shorter shelf life than other leading brands. My order is expiring in 6 months from the day I received it.",3
"I bought these last month as part of an Amazon promotion - buy 5 items get %40 percent off.  I had never heard of this product, but have a soft spot in my belly for the snacks I grew up on as a kid.  These things turned out way better than expected.  They are essentially pork rinds from your typical supermarket, but they are fresh - still crackling and popping after you open the bag.  I'm addicted to these now and have had to ratio them out so I don't eat them every night.  They're THAT good.",5
"I just finished a 32 ounce bottle of Lakewood Organic Lemonade. What a joy to drink lemonade that tastes great without high fructose corn syrup, sugar, cane sugar, or sugar substitute.  This lemonade has pure agave and white grape juice used for sweeteners; therefore, I can serve it with confidence knowing that it is good for me and my family. I don't think I will ever buy another brand of lemonade again.  Try it . . . you'll love it!",5
"This product had pretty good reviews so I thought it would be safe to buy 4 packages, so I did. Boy am I full of regret now. I'm stuck with 4 packs of these beans and I can't return any them. The moment I opened the bag, I should've known. It had a stale sour smell to them. But the optimistic side of me said, these beans look fresh and plump, maybe it won't smell like that once I scrape the seeds out. I was wrong. I made two test batches to see if it was the salt I was using to make my vanilla salt but they both have that weird sour, rancid smell. I've made vanilla salt before so I know what it's supposed to smell and taste like. Unfortunately, even after a few days, this smell isn't going away. I was really looking forward to making jars of vanilla salt to give out as cheap gifts. But now I need to go buy more vanilla beans to replace these which is going to end up costing me. I'm so disappointed. I haven't cooked with these seeds so I don't know if the taste and smell transforms with heat or with any other mixed in ingredient. I know for sure though that if you're looking to make vanilla extract, vanilla sugar or vanilla salt, I HIGHLY discourage you from buying this product.",1
"Our two beagles seemed to prefer Newman's over MilkBone.<br /><br />With each dog, we conducted two separate sniff-taste tests between Newman's Own Lamb and Barley Dog treat and the small size MilkBone Essentials Plus Optimal Health Biscuits. We figured the MilkBone product was more like the Newman's than the fake dog jerky-a.k.a. dog crack- we also had on the shelf. The tests took place after they had eaten meals.<br /><br />The test subjects were<br />1.  Maggie - the almost 9-year-old vacuum cleaner beagle who will eat anything, especially if it comes out of a plastic bag (have to warn visitors who bring their toiletries in zip bags because she will take the bags outside).<br />2. Lucy - the 8-year-old rescue beagle we took in, who is pickier about her chow, but can sniff out anything food related from 4-feet away (she could have a career sniffing out illegal food in luggage, seriously).<br /><br />The test method was to hold 1/2 of a Newman's treat in one hand and a Milkbone in the other. First we let them smell our hands with the treats inside our fists. Then we did the switcheroo behind our back and put them out in open palms.<br /><br />Both dogs preferred the smell of Newman's after breakfast and went for the little square as soon as we opened our hands.<br /><br />The sniff part of the after dinner tests were a little inconclusive. Maggie went for the Newman's completely. But Lucy was a little confused at first. She kept sniffing the Milkbone hand initially -- but we believe there was contamination problem with the test because I had just eaten a Cheez-It. After the old switcheroo, she went for the Newman's instantly.<br /><br />So, the dogs preferred to eat the Newman's, but Lucy initially preferred the faint smell of Cheez-Its contaminant in one sniff test session.<br /><br />From a cookie giver's perspective, Newman's did not have an overwhelming gross smell to it. The bag it comes in has a zip top, so they may keep their scent longer than the average Milkbone turning stale inside a cardboard box.<br /><br />Note: I did think the obviously Photoshopped Paul Newman graphic on the packaging was a little creepy. I'm sure he hadn't had arms that looked like that since ""Cool Hand Luke."" It might be time to just let his image rest in peace.",4
"I received a sample of the soft-baked cookie with raisins from Influenster! The cookie smelt amazing, was soft just as it said, I know it's healthier than regular cookies, and it seemed homemade, straight out of the oven!!! I will be buying some for sure!",5
"I had tried Wabash Vally Farms popcorn before and sought out a place where I could purchase it online.  I can sometimes find it in my area and but only in small quantities.  This is by far the best popcorn with few unpopped kernels, less husks and a great flavor.  I highly recommend this product.  Fantastic!!",5
"Alot of BBQ sauce for the price...I am from Hawaii, but I live in Georgia due to being in the military. So its never cheap to order or have family send this from home. This product came at a great price. If you like that classic natural BBQ taste, try this out. I especially use this for chicken. Marinate for 24hrs, add some sugar to the marinade if you want it on the sweet side. Once your meat hits the grill, you will know you made the right choice just by the smell.",5
"Just had this to make a PB&J and I was really just eating a jelly sandwich. I guess it would be ok to mix into a smoothie (maybe), but I didn't think it had any flavor at all.",1
i used this product on my face along with alba papaya facial mask and it cleared my acne amazingly!! i was so pleased with this product its gental and smells fantastic and i recamend this product to women and men !!,5
"This is very tasty. Good deal to save a few bucks here on Amazon as well. I find this dish very similar to the Chicken Tikka Masala. Both are great, obviously this curry dish has more curry flavor than the Chicken Tikka Masala. The chicken in this dish is wonderful as well.",4
Pork ramen is a family favorite but for some reason it is very hard to find in my location.  So happy to find out on Amazon at not a bad price!  Arrived in good condition...will buy again.,5
"i bought several of these two pound bags so i can take them with me overseas because of the generally very good reviews, in spite of the few very negative reviews - one i remember reading sticks in my mind now ""it tastes like pecan and water"" - i had that same experience with the first cup that i made, but by making it really strong (lots of beans, ground really fine) it was better.  but still, overall, it is not that great. not horrible so i throw it all out, but i will not buy it again.<br /><br />it smells too sweet, too strong - i think they WAY overdo it on the pecan flavoring because as soon as i open the fridge i can smell the coffee its kind of nauseating.<br /><br />my mom described it best i think - it tastes like those flavored coffees you find at gas stations.",2
"After reading a lot of reviews I decided to try this stuff.  Everyone seemed to agree that you could use for any recipe as replacement for flour.  It does not work!!  We also didn't realize that it was not meant for yeast, until we got the delivery and saw on the package.  So you can't make bread with it.  We also tried things like pie crust which is pretty simple and it did not turn out either.  Will definitely be going back to Pamela's products.  They are much better and easier to switch to!!!  Buyer beware of this one.",1
These bars are so good!!!  They really do taste like coconut cream pie and are so good for you!  I love that they taste so good and my kids love them..so I don't feel guilty letting them indulge! Can't wait to try all the flavors they make!,5
my wife ordered 3 as gifts. She's happy with them. These things are large compared to the normal mate gourds. It's a good product but pricey for the value you're getting.,3
Very good.  Much better than Wasa crispbreads.  My wife and I both enjoy this product.,5

"When I first opened the package of Petite Cruisine Grilled Tuna the cat was no where in sight.  But I swear I wasn't done opening it and she came running.  And begged and begged and begged.<br /><br />The removal of the treat from the bag was not an enjoyable experience.  You will get the juice and the stink all over your hand and they don't stay together as one piece, they flake apart (as fish is supposed to I guess).  Next time I will use a fork to remove them from the package.  But the cats LOVED these treats.  Would I buy them?  Yes, as a special treat for the kitty's I would.  As an everyday treat?  No - too messy and hard to handle.",4
Emerils Jazzed Up Decaf is the best decaf coffee ever.  It is full of flavor without any bitterness.  This one is a keeper.,5
"I heard of Fox's chocolate syrup in a discussion about the best chocolate syrup.  I was on a cruise and our dining companions were discussing the merits of various chocolate syrups when one of them remarked about Fox's.<br />I told them I was partial to Bosco, the one I grew up with, but couldn't find where we live. She offered to send me a jar of Fox's when we returned to our respective homes.  She sent it, I loved it and so when the jar ran out, I ordered more.  Thank you!",5
This is a repeat purchase for me..I cannot be without this delicious and healthy alternative to cholesterol or trans fat laden oils. Great on toast and for adding flavor to rice and vegetables!<br />Search the Internet and read all the good news about organic coconut oil and how great it is for your body's well being.,5
"You get 24 bags in the case. I remember this vintage '70's candy very well, 30 years ago I used to love to buy it and nibble at the tiny nuggets of gum. The miner themed cloth bag was a cool leftover you could use as a prop with your toys or to carry some treasures around like rocks or your bottlecap collection. I remember the flavor didn't last long after you chewed it, but long enough to get some great flavor. Glad they still make, my son enjoys it now.<br />The seller Hoemtown Favorites at Amazon that carries this sells some great retro food, snacks and soda. Be sure to check it out!",5
I came across Canidae when we adopted a 3 week puppy whose mother had transitioned.  We didn't know how to care for him properly so we went to the local pet store and they said Canidae was the food to use and to use it throughout his life.  We simply wet the food for the first few weeks before going completely dry and he has loved it throughout.  We also feed it to our 65 pound Goldendoodle and he loves it as well.  Definitely a great find.,5
This pasta dish is amazing!  Very easy to prepare and tastes very fresh because the noodles are not boiled until you make it.  It is also very filling because the pasta is made from whole wheat and high in fiber.  The sauce is extremely tasty and not at all like a typical convenience food.  I do recommend eating it right out of the container though because it does a good job of keeping it hot.  When I pour it into a bowl or plate after cooking it gets cold way to fast.,5
"This is a good starter set at a good price if you would like to try the tea, mate, and bombillas.  The tea arrived fresh and has a very nice flavor, not too bitter. The mate is a little different than what is pictured, and a little smaller. However, it is a gourde so it's understandable that they will vary in size. I like the bombillas, and cleaning it hasn't been a problem so far.  Just make sure to rinse it as soon as you are done using it.<br /><br />I took off one star only because the product packaging was somewhat sloppy. If it were to be given as a gift, I would have had to repackage the whole thing. The shipping was fast, and the shipping box itself was neat and sturdy.",4

"I just got the Arriba Red Salsa and the Chipotle Salsa today and boy do they taste weird. The red salsa is not too chunky which I like but is not spicy and tastes more like chili than it does as a salsa. The red salsa tastes like a chili without chunks of anything in it that a chili normally does so it was an unexpected flavor for me in a chili, although I love roasted salsas just not this one. The chipotle chili was awful. When I opened it the smell alone was suspect, it smelt like a farm with cattle or like a horse stable with a distinct hay smell. When my husband and I tried it, it tasted like it smelled like hay. It was almost like we had just walked up to a cow or a horse and licked its side or something. I love my salsas and have tried so many, but these two do not make the cut. I paid $4.69 in store for them at Shoprite. I can recommend some good salsas like Mitch Williams Mild or his Wild salsa. It is really chunky, has a good spicy kick, and a nice picante tomato salsa flavor (One of my favs). Margaritaville makes a very fresh tasting salsa; I think it's the garden one. It is a chunkier salsa like fresh salsas normally are but has some sauce to it and a very nice cilantro flavor. This salsa is definitely a favorite when I want a fresh ""clean"" tasting salsa. A more run of the mill salsa, that is easier to find, is Pace's picante salsa. Pace is good tasting overall with a little bit more chunks than I like but has a good strong tomato and spice taste.  Hope this helps!",2
I have had one of these plants for years. The only plant I've managed not to kill. So I ordered a small one for a friend who also has a black thumb. This little guy was shipped during a horrible heat wave and arrived in beautiful condition. It was really well packed and shipped very fast. The price is just terrific for such a great little plant. Highly recommend seller.,5
"My dog's poop is generally soft and hot and my son and I dislike that oozing-between-the-fingers feeling on the pickup.  Works well on most dog poops, not effective on diarrhea.

"I used to eat these King B beef jerky sticks all the time when I was younger, they were my favorite! I figured once King B was gone so was my beloved jerky, but luckily Jack Links has brought it back. This jerky is above and beyond any of that overly-sweet bagged jerky Jack links sells. No, instead this is the way jerky should be, nice and chewy and salty yum. I know some people on here complained about the saltiness but I don't think they're overly salty, they're just plain delicious. Order some, you won't regret it.",5
"having horses, my first feeling when I opened the bag, it smells like hay..was not happy to see it doesn't come as presented in picture. I had gotten one as a gift & the actual bag is just a plain bag with no brewing suggestions on it at all..the visual of the gold bag as a gift was much nicer, & I feel the real deal should be displayed..the tea itself is ok..much like a green tea, so adding honey is a must, at least for my taste or agave sweetener..buy again? only if it really grows on me!",4
"I love using this product because I can use 100% real whipping cream and still have it hold its shape enough to decorate with. Up until now, I have been using a whipped topping base that leaves a funny aftertaste, and have to keep in the freezer until ready to use, but I lost my local supplier, so needed to find something I could just order online. I add 2 T. of this product per cup of whipping cream, and add about 1/4 cup of powdered sugar and few drops of clear vanilla...perfect. Holds up even without refrigeration for several hours. Even though this is gelatin based, I like being able to just add the powder instead of having to go through the ordeal of softening, heating, dissolving, cooling, etc. the gelatin before adding it to the cream. I highly recommend this product to any serious decorator who is looking for a great whipped cream stabilizer.",5
"This product is great!  I have been using it for several years now.  I use it in everything I make.  No joke.  It is great on steak, chicken, fish, in salads, all my cooking.  It has a wonderful flavor without all the salt.  I highly recommend it.",5
"The image and text promised the new packaging, so I was expecting very fresh candy.  Instead, I received the old packaging.

"For those with clumping problems: I have encountered this too.  It happens when the cereal soaks up too much moisture from the air!  Seal the bag carefully, and if the air where you live is especially moist, you might even consider transferring the cereal to another container that can be sealed airtight.<br /><br />I've been eating this stuff for YEARS and I still love it just as much as I did when I started.  While I think the Honey Almond Flax variant is somewhat tastier, this one does take significantly longer to develop any rancidity.  This may be due to the omission of the flaxseed which contains polyunsaturated linolenic oils which, though healthy, are highly prone to oxidation (I am extremely sensitive to this; my friends and family can't tell and think I'm crazy).  This may be a consideration for you if you are similarly sensitive and take a while to finish the six boxes in this multipack!<br /><br />I share an apartment with two other college-aged guys.

"I am only reviewing the Bacon flavor, but my dogs picked up on how this works pretty quickly and love the taste of it.  At first they wanted to bite the bottle and chew it like a treat but I worked with them for about a minute or so and they got down that you only lick it.  I have 3 dogs and all three of them liked the taste of it.  I like it because it seems like a more personal treat than just a dog biscuit.  I recommend this!",4
for this food! Sam loves this stuff and it's not as stinky as cheaper brands of canned catfood. I'm going to order other flavors for him to try.,5
I make sandwiches with this stuff for work everyday; it's delicious.<br /><br />I'm not sure why it has a picture of a cat on the can though.<br /><br />I hope it doesn't have cat meat...,5
Great coffee!! I love the rich flavor and the fact it is available in k-cups makes it even better:) everyone should try this!!,5
I do not mind the taste of most low-cal sweeteners but I  prefer natural foods. This product is an improvement as it does come from plant sources and claims to be 100% natural.I tried it in iced tea and sprinkled on strawberries and liked it better than the alternatives - less metallic tasting  than stevia and less artificial tasting  than aspartame. Not as good as sugar but the best low -cal sweetener I've tried.,4
"I'll be fully frank: I'm not a health food fan. I tend to avoid things that say ""organic"" on them like the plague. Not that I eat only junk, but in my experience a lot of things that are labeled as health food simply don't taste edible.<br /><br />I was very skeptical that this granola would be healthy and delicious, but I was wrong! How good is Love Crunch? I had to pry it away from my kids AND my husband just to get a taste!!<br /><br />What sets Love Crunch apart is two things: the fruit bits and the chocolate bits. The chocolate is delicious! Dark chocolate pieces that taste as chocolate should. Very yummy! The fruit pieces shocked me because many of them are tiny, but they pack a huge punch when you put one in your mouth.<br /><br />The only downside to this bag is that both my husband and I wished for more chocolate and more fruit pieces. The granola was delicious, however, and almost tasted like it was a crunchy no-bake chocolate cookie that had been smashed up.<br /><br />We were definitely surprised by this granola and are going to be ordering more!",5
"2 cups is the perfect size to yield 1 quart of hazelnut milk the way I make it. The nuts are smaller so I suppose that makes them filberts ... but 2-cups is 2 cups. The two I have used have been fresh and tasty so when we get down to 1 left, I'll order more.<br /><br />My recipe<br />2- cups hazelnuts<br />4-5 organic dates<br />4-5 cups of water (how thick do you like it whole or skim consistency)<br /><br />Blend on soup setting (not to where it's hot, just totally emulsified. Then strain through nut milk bag. Refrigerate and enjoy. Use left over ""cheese"" to make hazelnut cheese...our son loves it.<br /><br />Update (7/1/2011): I have since move to using Amazon's Subscribe and Save option and get a shipment of these once a month. Also we no longer use dates int he milk, just the nuts and 34oz of water.",5
"This is a great products, kids love it.  Good for cooking!  If you buy them in the store they will cost you quite abit more for a single pack. 6 pack was a good deal.",5
"If you've never tried this you're missing out...this product is great for camping trips or at home/at work.  I bought the 4 pack and I've already gone through two of the boxes in about 2 weeks.<br /><br />The flavor is great, it doesn't have that odd chemical taste you so often get with artificial sweeteners, and the creamer it's mainly composed of makes for a nice thick drink, almost like a cappuccino from the store.<br /><br />Highly suggest you get some and try it.",5
"I've just finished my first container of CLICK (mocha). I make mine in the blender every morning.  Blending ensures creamy texture and no undissolved globs.  I make mine with half water and half skim-milk.  It has replaced morning coffee for me.  I absolutely recommend this to anyone looking for a tasty, easy, and fast way to get some protein and caffeine at the same time.  Please try from a blender if you've had bad luck with getting drinks like this to have the right texture.  I'm awaiting my second container from Amazon.<br />As a side note: I have mixed it in part with Slim-Fast powder as a way to increase the vitamins and nutritional value when I felt I needed more calories. Keep an eye on the carbs, though.<br />This is a great product I plan to continue using.",5
"I love this salt. I pour a handful in a hot tub, squirt in some Dr. BronnerPeppermint Castile Soap and soak my troubles away for about twenty minutes. Your skin is so soft and supple when your bath is over and you are so relaxed you can just wrap yourself in some soft pjs and drift off to sleep. Try a salt bath with this salt - not the magnesium bath salts you usually use. You will not believe the difference.",5
This oatmeal is without a doubt the best thing to come down the pike.  I am 77 years old and my mother made me Quaker oatmeal as a child - but this steel cut is so delicious I will never go back to that paper tasting slop again.  Thanks for a fine product.  I am indoctrinating all my friends.,5
"I got a big bottle of this, and ended up bringing it to work to let everyone else eat it for me.  It just tastes too sweet for me.  It is great on some things (I liked it on popcorn) but there are other hot sauces out there that have good heat without the sweet flavor.  For someone that likes the sweet flavor, it would be a great hot sauce, but for me, I couldn't get past the sweetness.",3
"We have a year old bullmastiff and have tried Iams which she would eat but wasn't too crazy about. We decided to go with Wellness, a little pricey but well worth it.",5
I love this coffee with cream and sugar-free caramel syrup (with Splenda).  It has a smooth taste...perfect for my morning coffee.,5
"I saw Bobby Flay using Muscovado Sugar in one of his bbq sauce recipes.  Since my local market didn't have it, I went right on Amazon and found it... Wonderful product & service - came SOO quickly! A+++!",5
"I was looking for a replacement for my morning biscotti, something a bit more nutritious.  After searching on Amazon and reading reviews of breakfast snacks,<br />I decided to try these bars.  I'd had a KIND bar once and sort of remembered it was good. Well, these are FANTASTIC!  At first bite, I realized there were chunks of sweet mango, the intense mango flavor hit my palate, and it tasted real, not at all artificial.  This was followed by a bit of cruncy coconut which just perfectly tempered the sweet mango.  The macadamia's added a stronger crunch with just a hint of honey.  So I tried the ultimate test:  I gave one to my co-worker (out of the package, a blind test). This person lives on junk food and considers Krispy Kreme one of the four major health groups!  She absolutely loved this bar and sat down and ordered some on her break!!  The ones from Amazon were received in two days, expiration date was Dec 2010 (ordered April). They are fresh and the price was great with subscribe and save.  Love that I am getting some extra calcium and vitamin D (and no, you can't taste whatever they put in to add that).  I'll be ordering these regularly through subscribe and save. I just have to make sure I don't eat them for snacks, just for breakfast, or I'll run out =)",5
"I have been giving my dog these treats since she has been a puppy.  She loves them and were great rewards for her training.  Best of all, they have kept her teeth and gums clean and free of plaque.  I recommend them to all dog owners.  Buying them from Amazon on a recurring basis has been a lifesaver.  These treats do not last long on store shelves so finding them locally has been difficult.  Thanks Amazon for solving my source problem!",5
"I have long been a fan of Honey Maid graham crackers.  They are just about my favorite snack food for me and the kids.  In the past, I would break them into halves so that they could fit conveniently in whatever bag I was using for lunches or outings.  On top of that, I would have to remove them from their sealed bags into a Ziploc bag, which always seemed redundant.  Now, I can just move them from the box into whatever bag I am using and it is super fast and convenient--the perfect snack to grab quickly when heading out the door.",5
"Excellent product, flimsy packaging by mfr (biscuits crumble when opening the packet), good packaging (box and air pillows) by Amazon.  However this time Amazon shipped items a month prior to the product expiration date which is a form of dumping rather than returning to the mfr for newer product.",2
"My two boy kitties LOVE this food...they have been eating it for a couple months now and they still meow like crazy when they hear us opening the cans!  We mix in just a little bit of dry food with it and they clean their dishes every time!  And one of the kitties would turn his nose up at everything we tried, but he really loves this food!!<br />We are very happy to have found it.<br />Update: They STILL LOVE IT!  We've tried other canned foods just to mix it up for them, but nothing makes them happier than this chicken.",5
"These bars are not a great on-the-go alternative to granola bars because their chocolate coating make them very messy. They come two to a package, which makes for easy sharing between two siblings. My kids like the taste fine.",3
I think I'm thoroughly hooked on the Timothy's Columbian decaf.<br />It has a great flavor and not at all bitter.  I started out with<br />the 24 pack and have since ordered the 50 in a box.  I think I<br />will make a cup right now!,5
"I heard about drinking sage tea on the Dr. Oz show. Though sage is most commonly used in cooking, sage tea has been shown to boost alertness and mood, while decreasing anxiety, I was told.<br /><br />I find it very soothing. I was surprised that I actually like the taste. It's a woodsy taste just very appealing. It always makes me feel good afterward. The tea is caffeine free so I normally drink it in the afternoon or evening as I still need the caffeine coffee provides in the morning.<br /><br />This is a great product and I will most likely order it again.",5
"The Hip Action Salmon Flavor was very disappointing indeed.  I stopped trying to force feed my older cat, covering it with soft cat food, and even using the pill pockets.  Even our younger cats, about a year old and who usually gobble up everything, don't touch it.<br /><br />Good luck in getting your cat to eat these...I had read many positive reviews so I was very disappointed to find that they are not tasty at all to all of our five cats.  It has kind of a weird smell also. I need to find another brand that the cats enjoy eating.",2
"Another Minnesotan who frequently could not enjoy his backyard and deck due to swarms of the Minnesota state bird.  Our mosquitos have been known to carry off small children.  This product won't prevent all the mosquitos - but it sure knocks them down for a few weeks.<br /><br />Does anybody else think it is odd that the price for just the product alone is MORE than the price for the product in the bottle with the built in sprayer?  I don't think their sprayer is very good, so I buy the cheapest I can get and dump it into my Ortho hose-end sprayer...<br /><br />Now... why can't we buy this stuff in gallon or 5 gallon jugs?",5
The coffee is wonderful with no bitter taste or after taste. I prefer a Cappucino style of coffee with all ingredients pre mixed. This is one of the best that I have tried and I know I will be re-ordering when I am done with my original purchase.,5
"I am british and every year I try to get special items for Christmas.  I just ate one of these flakes and it was stale and dry.  I could not tell what the use by date was as it was in arabic.  This is the first time I have used this company, will not use them again.",1
"These are the smaller versions of natural bones.  My dogs were quietly working on these bones for a couple of days.  Then they buried the smaller pieces for I guess future feasting.  Great bones, great value.  Dogs love them.",5
"The taste is not sweet at all but more light and refreshing. During the heat wave we are having now, chilled this is a good drink. I do feel more energy all day and not hungry for a couple of hours. I have tried chia seeds before and they add no taste so drinking them in the juice was OK. I will buy again, but too expensive to become a habit.",5
"Maybe I got a bad batch? This stuff doesn't even remotely smell like soy OR vanilla. It's so unappealing that I can't even bring myself to mix some up and try it - and usually soy protein powder is a pretty standard product that tastes pretty good (to me, anyway). Thumbs down on this one - something's not quite right here!",1
I did not find the product effective in preventing yellow and spotted leaves on my rose bushes.  I will not use it again.,2
"This toy is a big waste of money.  I threw it several times and it hardly even rolled at all, then bobbed just a bit before stopping completely.  Two cats I know rate it as a big YAWN.  Anyone know a motion toy that works, hopefully on carpet and floor?",1
"The first shipment of Campbell's Select Potato Broccoli Cheese soup package arrived safely, and I could enjoy the soup I like that rarely is in stock at the local grocery story. I would give that shipment 5 stars.<br /><br />BUT the second shipment, received a few days ago, was in very poor condition. Most of the cans were bent inward, so I am wary if they are safe to eat or not.<br /><br />Can replacements be obtained?",2
"UPDATE_ July 2012<br /><br />I found a great way to beat the summer heat- i empty a can of this fruit cocktail into a freezer safe bowl- leave it in the freezer for 1 1/2 to 2 hours- and then i get to eat lightly frozen fruit cocktail- it's very refreshing and cooling_and the entire can is only like 150 calories.  i suppose i could also throw the gently frozen fruit into a blender and make a sorbet of sorts--i'm just finishing a bowl of gently frozen libby's peaches- peach sorbet would be yummy<br />-----------<br /><br />The best part is the no added sugar. Not packed in syrup. Only natural juices & splenda.<br />This variety seems to have more fruit and less juice than say the just peaches or just pears.<br />This might also be more firm than the just peaches or just pears.<br />Long shelf life_ more than a year till sell by date.<br />The only thing i don't like is the candied cherries-yuck__the few cans i've eaten so far haven't had many of those thank goodness- plus they don't seem to be mixed throughout the can_ there's been  a few cherries at the bottom of every can. yours may be differnt?<br /><br />Regardless, it was decent. If you can get this for $1.25 ish per can with free s/h it's a very good deal. You can order 24 or 36 cans at a time_ imagine carrying that home from the grocery store.",4
"This is my favorite small pearl tapioca.  I have used this brand for decades.  I have also used many other brands, when I could not get this one.  I do not use ""quick"" tapiocas;  they are not especially quick and the results are gluey.  Bascom's tapioca is my favorite because the pearl size is very uniform with an absolute minumum of broken pearls and powder, and the pearls are very smooth and cook up well, with a very smooth and even consistency.<br /><br />The recipe on the box is good, but I prefer to reserve the egg whites, beat them to stiff peaks, and fold them in at the end.  The pudding sets up just as well yet is very fluffy, like a great mousse.  To avoid any risk of salmonella, use pasteurized eggs.<br /><br />These pearls do need to be soaked in water before cooking.  I soak them overnight and cook in the morning, or soak them all day and cook in the evening (my family likes tapioca pudding for breakfast).  I soak them in the refrigerator.",5
"I just came upon this amazing coffee holder for keurig coffees. Not only does it fit 30 coffees at a time, My Keurig fits right on top of it so it takes up a lot less space on my counter. It also makes it easier to refill the water because it is elevated. Purchase this and it will help your coffees stay neat, clean , and organized!!!",5
"The mojito is one of The Wiofe's favorite drinks and the kids got a kick out of the Appletini moctail, so we gave this one a shot too.  I think there's a noticeable medicine taste, as with most sugar-free drinks, but they love them.",4
"Purchased as a gift for a young man just beginning to date, and concerned about his personal appearance. Has a pleasant but not overwhelming scent and he seems pleased with it.",5
"I took in a foster cat almost one year ago and have tried almost everything to rid him of diarrhea.  The vets were unable to diagnose any parasite or physical problems, and his behavior has always appeared happy and healthy.  The vets said it could be a food allergy, so I began trying different foods.  A couple of months ago, I bought SD Sensitive Stomach.  I had been reluctant because of the ingredients - I strive to avoid foods with ""meal"" of any kind - as well as the price ($40 for 15.5 lbs).  After a year, five other foods and several supplements, though, I was desperate.  Sensitive Stomach did the trick.  There was a noticeable difference within a few weeks, and the stools are completely normal now.  His weight gain has been constant regardless of food, so I do not attribute that to the Science Diet brand.<br /><br />The drawback is that my other two cats prefer this food to their original brand, so it's quite expensive for three cats.  The other two have not gained weight with this product, and their appetite does not appear to have increased at all.",3
"I like having a low calorie snack, it helps keep me happy while I am dieting.  I open this package up right away, 70 calories per pouch.  These were the best gummy anything I have ever had.  Bonus they are organic so no chemical after taste like I get with some brands of gummy bears.  They may cost a little bit more but I have to say worth every cent and would recommend them to anyone (except my sister she is allergic to strawberries).  Having this sweet snack in the afternoon is going to help get to dinner without cleaning out the pantry.",5
"I love these cookies, generally, and the price is great here on Amazon, but sometimes I question where they come from.  In March, I received a shipment (TWELVE boxes) with an expiration date of 12 March 2011.  I thought that was kinda ""iffy"", and the cookies were a bit worn (they had that patina of old chocolate), but they were edible, so, okay.  In April, the expiration date was sometime in the far future (September or October of 2011), so I figured the March shipment was a fluke.  In May, the expiration date was *again* 12 March 2011!!  They were PAST expiration.<br /><br />Of course, I'm a carb freak so that didn't stop me from eating them, but, C'MON!!  I'm almost scared to get my next shipment.",2
"I found the sesame bagel crisps as fresh as those purchased locally. Very flavorful eaten as a snack, but not so overpowering that the chip fights with a dip or spread. Actually, too good -- no worries that they will go stale because the bag is emptied too soon. Only problem was that Amazon shipped in the original case meant for store display - which means there's a large perforated flap across 2/3 of the front of carton -- opened during shipping and 3 front bags were bagel dust rather than chips. Back bags were fine for party fare.",5
"I love oatmeal for breakfast, but it takes so long to prepare it and then sweeten it and add mix-ins that I usually don't have time. This instant granola is just about perfect. The only thing wrong with it is that it's a bit too sweet. When I don't have time to make oatmeal in the morning, I throw one of these packs into my bag and make it when I get to work. It's also a great portion manager; it takes the guesswork out of how much oatmeal is in one serving.",4
"My Father-in-Law, highly recommended Zoe Olive Oil, because it was a good olive oil and it came in a tin vs. a glass container.<br /><br />I have now in a few short months ordered 6 cans, (twin packed) so 3 orders, have given 1 away as a gift, and recommeded to several Friends.<br /><br />I really like the taste, quality and value of the olive oil, and highly recommend it to all.",5
"I see two reviews saying this is made in Thailand.  I would like to know why people think this since it only says Hawaii on the bottles.  Could someone please let me know why people are saying this is made in Thailand?<br />On the first page of the Ito-En website it says it is imported from Japan.<br /><br />I find this to be the most delicious refreshing tea there is.  It is like drinking the delicate juice of the jasmin flower.  Jasmin is the most often used natural fragrance essence ingredient in perfumes.  The flower has a scent that carries far and is what heaven must smell like.<br /><br />You wouldn't ordinarily think that a tea flavored with flowers would be good but this is delicious.  It does say on the list of ingredients that real jasmin is used.<br /><br />I have been getting this at Whole Foods and paying almost two dollars a bottle for it.  I have no problem downing two bottles of this a day.  I checked the bottles from Whole Foods and they say Hawaii, no mention of Thailand, so I'm not sure exactly where this is actually made or if Hawaii is simply the import area, or it is actually made there.  But it's no problem as it is delicious and hasn't killed me yet so I am purchasing a case here to save money.  I also signed up for automatic delivery.  The only problem is I need more than twelve bottles a month.<br /><br />If I knew for sure it was made in Thailand I would still get it.<br />I'm not suffering any ill effects after drinking two bottles a day for the past month.",5
I bought 2 Jack Link's Beef Steak pack of 12. One of the two packs was open and had only 11 Beef Steaks. Also the meat is very tough to chew unlike when you buy from grocery stores.,1
"This tea is very good, not bitter or watery with a balanced blend of spices and tea flavors. It is now my Chai of choice replacing my Teavana tea. I also like Macha in my steamed milk that I use to make my Chai (I make it both without milk and as a Latte) see my review on Macha's.",5

"I've probably tried 40+ (maybe more than that) k-cup varieties thus far and this is the only one that is just plain horrible.  The powder rarely comes out correctly (and the fact that you are talking about a powered cider should stop you right there), it has a far too-sweet taste, and well, frankly, it just tastes bad.  My wife and I found the Green Mountain naturals Cider cups on clearance locally (we liked them so much we went back and bought like 16-18 boxes), but I have problems with sugar so I thought I would try this.  Bad idea.  It is borderline undrinkable.  It is, however, better cold than hot, but that's not saying much.  Low price, low quality.  Even the physically cup itself isn't made as well as the ""real"" k-cups.  It is made to fit in a Keurig brewer.  It is not a true k-cup.  Note that the title says ""for Keurig K-Cup Brewers"".  It is worded that way for a reason.  Avoid like the plague.  If you can handle sugar, check out the Green Mountain version.  If you can't, well, I've not found a better choice either.  In fairness, apparently everything this company makes isn't horrible.  My wife loves their Peppermint Hot chocolate.  Neither one of us can stand this crap however.",1
Convenient packaging!  Easy to use as coconut oil has to be heated (in warm water) to be in a liquid state and I just put this container in a bowl of hot tap water.  Stores well too!,4

"Although these are a little messy with the chicken wrapped around the pork, I will continue to buy these because my dogs love them.  They know exactly where I keep them on top of the fridge, and will stand next to the fridge when they have a craving.  My vet recommends the porkhide over the rawhide (NOT pig ears), and so these are just what the doctor ordered.  Plus, since my local store stopped carrying them, it's lucky that I can find them here on Amazon for such a great price.",5
My husband likes this coffee.  I prefer Nantucket blend which is not quite so strong.,5

One ounce contain approximately 20% of the RDA for an adult recommended dietary allowance (RDA)<br />Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) the amounts of selected nutrients considered adequate to meet the known nutrient needs of healthy people. The RDA is based on scientific knowledge and has been presented by a committee of the Food and Nutrition Board (FNB) of the National Academy of Sciences (NAS). The Canadian equivalent is the Recommended Nutrient Intakes. RDA is generally accepted throughout the world as a valid source of information. At least 40 different nations have as well as organizations have published standards similar to the RDA.<br /><br />Magnesium is the fourth most abundant mineral in the body and is essential to good health. Approximately 50% of total body magnesium is found in bone. The other half is found predominantly inside cells of body tissues and organs. Only 1% of magnesium is found in blood, but the body works very hard to keep blood levels of magnesium constant.<br />Magnesium is needed for more than 300 biochemical reactions in the body. It helps maintain normal muscle and nerve function, keeps heart rhythm steady, supports a healthy immune system, and keeps bones strong. Magnesium also helps regulate blood sugar levels, promotes normal blood pressure, and is known to be involved in energy metabolism and protein synthesis. There is an increased interest in the role of magnesium in preventing and managing disorders such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes. Dietary magnesium is absorbed in the small intestines. Are you taking enough magnesium in the diet? The recommended daily allowance is 300mgs/day for men, 350mgs for women. Magnesium is extremely safe by mouth - too much simply causes diarrhea. Try increasing the amount of magnesium you take by mouth until it causes diarrhea, then reduce the dose slightly so it does not.

"This tea was suggested by Dr. Oz on his show about how to sleep better. I suffer from insomnia<br />so I bought the wheat germ, Chia seeds and Valerian tea he said would help. Haven't used the wheat germ yet, the Chia seeds we are absolutely loving, especially on top of a crisp salad, but the Valerian tea tastes so horrible I can't even force myself to sip it while holding my nose! It has a real earthy, almost ""manure"" like taste. The woman he had try it on the show sipped it and said ""Oh, that's not bad!"" So I took a chance. I swear, they must have paid her to give it a tasty review. It's vile and I already threw all three boxes of it in the trash!",1
"I've loved the brown sugar flavor of this cereal for years, but hadn't tried the cinnamon version until recently.  It's quite similar to the brown sugar version, except for the hint of cinnamon, and I'll warn you that it is just a hint; if you're looking for a very strong cinnamon flavor, this is not the right cereal for you.<br /><br />From a texture standpoint, it's crunchy and robust, holding up well in milk without getting soggy. But it's also not so crunchy or robust that it's unpalatable, like the straw- or raw-twine-like texture of some high fiber cereals. It has a decent amount of fiber per serving (5 grams, which is kind of the cutoff for ""healthy"" cereals, in my opinion), and a pretty good slug of protein (6 grams, which is enough to make it fairly filling), and it has a good amount of whole grain oats. And it is just perfect for my taste in terms of sweetness, having enough sugar that I don't need to add any but not so much that I feel like I'm eating candy.  The main problem I have with it is that my kids love it so much we go through a box in no time (unlike other ""healthy"" cereals, which the kids wouldn't touch with a ten-foot pole).",5
Use with coffee mate for a good taste. I put it in a regular coffee pot.,5
"I love a good cup of coffee but hate to brew a pot or even brew one cup in a pot.  Marley Coffee gives me the option I have been looking for.  Coffee in a bag - you know, like a tea bag!  The coffee comes in a 15 single serve pods.<br /><br />While the box doesn't state that it is to be used in a one cup brewer or as a ""tea bag"", I tried it both ways.  It brews a great cup of coffee either way.  In fact, I brewed the bag in a one cup brewer first and then saved it for the next day.  I then tried it as a ""tea bag"" and even having been used previously, it brewed a great cup of coffee, dark and rich.<br /><br />I normally put milk/cream in my coffee but I found I liked it black.  WOW!  Even my picky husband liked the taste.<br /><br />I did note the box mentioned KICKS FOR CAUSE FOUNDATION.  It is nice to see a company care about our children.  They believe children should be able to be children so they started this soccer program.  Good for them.<br /><br />Good coffee and a children's program sponsor all in one product!  Go for it!",5
"These are luscious, chocolaty truffles.  Each piece is a pyramidal dollop, ~ 1cm diameter, of dark chocolate dusted with cocoa powder.  It is rich but not overly sweet, which makes one or two pieces perfect after a meal or with a cup of espresso. Yes, during the holidays Costco sells them for half the price for a 2-box pack.

the smell is heavenly to say the least..used it in many recipes and ate it as is as well...DELICIOUS:),5
This is a great starter.  I finally have my own SD starter.  Followed the directions included and in 2 days had a viable starter.  Smells good too!  Fast shipping.  I am thrilled.,5
used many brands over the years; this is BY FAR THE BEST I've ever used.  All good ingredients - you'll love it too.,5
"I received Old Country licorice in a gift basket for Valentine's day and fell in love. I ordered it in the 4/ 1 lb. tubs shown here and received it this past week. It is not soft, in fact it is a bit on the tough side. If you are considering making an order, wait for the bags. I do not think that the tubs are airtight.",1
"When you are in the mood for a powerful sugar rush or an overwhelming sweet tasted, Nerds hard candies is often the way to go.  They have very strong sweet flavor that can be overwhelming but is great when that is what you are in the mood for, and it has just a slight tangy taste as well.  I often eat Nerds in a movie theater, often more than I should.",4
"smokehouse almonds are great but i just can't take all of the salt so i rub some of the salt off of them and then i go to town, if they sold lightly salted ones i would probably not only be addicted but broke as well from eating them so much love love love this product and will buy again.",4
"I think this was the best purchase decision I made all year. When my kids were little I never let baked goods from the store in the house and every night ground flour to bake with but drifted away from that as they got older and flew the nest. After years of buying fairly adequate bread, crackers whatnot at the store I decided to go back to making my own.  I bought a Wondermill Jr. hand mill and based on previous reveiws here I ordered this Great River Organic Milling Hard Red Spring Wheat.<br /><br />The other reviewers were correct this is absolutely fabulous wheat. It has a very high gluten content and makes a very dark flavorful satisfying loaf.<br /><br />I would especially recommend this to anyone new to bread-making. I don't think you can make a bad load with this some good yeast and a bit of elbow grease.  I used the SAF Instant you can order buy the pound just like the big bakeries do. It's just plain good yeast.<br /><br />The best thing about this wheat is you can make each loaf for less than a dollar =))<br /><br />Oh...this wheat is not good for pie crusts pastry kind of things...the gluten content is too high and will make anything like that tough.  This is to make glorious bread.",5
"Love these Hot Ro-Tel Diced Tomatoes...too hard to find locally, so glad I can get them thru Amazon. Gives an extra kick to soups, stews & spaghetti sauce, too!",5
"I love Kettle Brand Chips!<br />I've been in love with the Honey Dijon for years and decided to try out their other flavors.<br /><br />Sea Salt & Vinegar Chips are TANGY, SOUR, and make my lips pucker when I eat too many at a time.  I got 12 big bags for a steal from amazon ($11 WHAT?!?).<br /><br />Personally, the flavor is too much for me, but my mom & aunt LOVE them and they hate potato chips.",4
"Bought a case of these bags.  They rip when going into the trash can.  Many tore just getting them off the roll.  If you create a small amount of trash and the bag is in the can for more than a few days, they deteriorate.  Rip when pulling from the trash can.  Had to double bag most upon removal or put on a plastic bag.  Throughly disappointed in the whole experience.  Think they are a waste of money.",1
"This is a very good alternative for people who have difficulty digesting cow's milk, but keep it to mixing in your coffee or baking/cooking needs. Just like evaporated regular milk it is not really suitable to reconstitute and drink normally or use in cold cereal (it's great in oatmeal and cream of wheat though!). If you are looking for a drinkable version I recommend the powdered variety offered by the same company.",4
"Took a chance on these Sticks and Jerky From Pacific Mountain Farms and was pleasently surprised to find out it is amazing.  Pacific Mountain Farms has its jerky made from elk, venison, buffalo, and bacon.  The Bacon Jerky is Amazing a must try for anyone who enjoys jerky.",5
I started taking wheatgrass tablets and noticed a slight change in my energy level. I stopped for about 2 weeks and boy did I notice a difference. Without them I was so tired and it was all I could do to go for my daily 2 mile walk. I really do believe in this product. And it is cheaper on Amazon that at your health foods store.,5
"Have tried may K-Cups this one is the best. It is a strong brew, so if you prefer something more mild, this one might not be for you.",5
"Being an 80's kid, I,ve only heard of maybe three of these candies before. The recipient however was born in the late 40's & he knew them all. Extra 'kudos' for the sky bar, zagnut, & moo pie. He swears I'll get hooked on some of these & I won't be able to find more anywhere else. And with the awesome deal from amazon during the week after black Friday really made this an awesome deal. Thanks",5
Delcious!  You don't even have to be gluten free to love them!  The Sesame seeds are a great substitute for extra salt!,5
"I own a Mr. Coffee TM3-2 3-Quart Ice Tea Maker and this loose tea is so much more convenient than de-tagging and stuffing 9 tea bags into it (especially with those metal staples in them, that's always bothered me)! The ice tea maker's instructions said to use 3 tablespoons of loose tea, but I think PG Tips is much stronger than your average black tea; I use half as much (1.5 tablespoons) and it's perfect for my Southern U.S. taste buds. Do use some standard coffee filters (I double-up) when brewing tea this way. I imagine with 2-quart ice tea maker you can reduce the amount of tea by 1/3 (1 tablespoon), but play around with it and see how you like it!",5
Under the product features it says all meats are sourced in the USA. I got the Lamb and Rice jerky today and it says on the package the Lamb comes from New Zealand. That's a huge misrepresentation of this product on the product page. Very disappointed.,1
I prepared mini muffins with pastel frosting and sprinkled the golden stars. They looked amazing! Then I made a cake with dark chocolate frosting and sprinkled the golden stars. They gave the elegant finish I was looking for.,5
"If you want to get a good sampling of a great tea, this is the way to do it--buy 20 or 50 tea bags as a trial before splurging on a larger order.  The sunk costs are only ten dollars U.S., there's free 2-day delivery via Amazon Prime, and you can decide later whether to stock up in earnest.<br /><br />Leaving aside sentimental attachments to T of H formed while sitting about the kitchen for hours drinking it and working on problem sets for e-mag and analytical mechanics with some of my good college friends, it must be said that Taylor's of Harrogate really know what they're about when it comes to tea...this in a way that many Americans may not equipped to really appreciate.  I'll skip mentioning some of the floor sweepings that you can find at the grocery store, but, for literate comparison, the good folks at Twinings are worldwide marketing experts and have made huge strides bringing a selection of decent teas to the peoples in many new markets, viz their English Breakfast is available 'round the world.  Taylor's of Harrogate are in my view another thing altogether.  I think they offer a better tea to a smaller market cross section.  The Scottish Breakfast itself is a wonderfully strong and brightly coloured tea--this is tea-nerd talk, granted--but the color (or colour) of it is remarkable; it gives you straight away the feeling that you've happened onto something rather special.  And the flavor (flavour, if you will) is, in the words of my tea-hound office cube-neighbor (neighbour...), ""manly.""  It'll give you a nice boost, but it won't wire you out.  It drinks well straight or with milk or even with cream, and of course a little sugar never hurt a breakfast tea.  If you like ""black"" teas (hong chaah!!), this is one you should not miss.",5
Fantastic texture on these oats. I would say these are the thickest rolled oats I have come across. They make a really great tasting breakfast!,5
"It is so great to have a low-fat, low-calorie, yet delicious brand of cookies available! I don't feel guilty after eating a few, and trust me, you will eat a few!!! I have a friend with a gluten allergy and its great to have something to offer her when she comes over that I can enjoy as well.  Definitely worth trying!",5
"This is a GREAT product!  Steaks are delicious with this rub.  I put it on about 4 hours before grilling.  The spices are delicious and penetrate the meat.  I highly recommend this product.  Because I couldn't find it in any stores near me, I ordered it on-line and found the company very responsive. Should be five stars.",5
The taffy I remember was more elastic and this taffy is extremely soft.  That might be seen as a good thing but it doesn't work for me.  It is also way too sweet for my taste.,2
"They are more potato crockets in the shape of a ball rather than Au Gratin, but nevertheless YUM YUM YUM!",4
"My kids, ages 8, 5, 4, 3 and 2, love the taste of this drink (they did not like the chocolate one).  We mix it with juice and water.  Water help its dissolve better.  I love that I am able to give them extra fruits/veggies each day with one great tasting drink.  Good source of antioxidants and has a wonderful alkalizing effect on their bodies.",5
"OK, I've bought the much more expensive ""ceremonial"" grade, but unless you're using it straight (and even then, I like the taste), I think it's got GREAT color and taste.  I primarily use it for smoothies, but also mix with half orange or lemon juice/half water and just pour a tsp or two in a water bottle, shake and drink (if using lemon, I add honey).  MUCH better deal because it's second harvest (and you should check out nutritionally, not such a bad thing) and love the sustained, slower energy boost than I get from coffee (that takes you high than leaves you flat).  This keeps me going all day. Oh,and I mix with Haagen dazs frozen vanilla yogurt and it's one of my favorite desserts.",5
I love these bars. The only reason they don't get 5 stars is their price. I tried to save money by buying them here instead of store but it turns out the difference in price is nearly irrelevant.... Cheaper but not as much as you would think.anyway taste and quality is great.,4
"Our Springer Spaniels (1.8 years) have proven to be FOOD SNOBS! As puppies, they ate purina puppy food, but they refused to move on and eat the adult food! We have tried several brands of Blue Buffalo, and it is a superb kibble! Overall, lamb is the best because the salmon food smells fishy (surprise!), and they prefer it over the chicken by just a little. We have noticed that they have put on healthy solid weight, their coats look *fantastic* and they eat much less because of the quality ingredients of Blue Buffalo. It is well worth your money! Happy doggiez = Happy dog mommiez (and daddiez)!",5
"I bought this as a gold-box deal, so I got a good price for this cat food; I probably wouldn't have bought it otherwise, since it's a tad bit on the expensive side. I try to buy healthier food for my cats. Since they both liked the liver and beef food from science diet, I figured they'd like this too. It turns out that only one of my cats like it, but the other won't touch it. I'm glad that at least one of them will eat it, otherwise, this would've been a waste of money. Other than that, this product seems to be good, and I like the fact that it's organic.",4
"These are some of the best snack bars I have ever tasted - very pure, you can see everything that's in it, no hidden junk. A little pricey, but much cheaper on Amazon.",5
To be honest I wish I had more to say about these chocolates but my Girlfriend ate all of them up before I had a chance to try very many! Far better then any of the Godiva chocolates I've ever had.,5
"This is just from my experience with my two toy dogs.  I bought this after searching the web for something more economical than Pill Pockets, with which I had great success.  Both my dogs refused to even lick this after a brief sniff and one of them eats anything.<br /><br />I gave the tub away to someone else to try with their larger dogs.<br /><br />YMMV Hope it works for you if you take a chance and buy it.",1
"No seriously, this is ridiculous, $45 for a bag of corn for obligate carnivores? brewers rice, corn gluten meal? wheres the meat?<br />Not to mention unnamed animal fat which could be anything including roadkill and euthanized shelter animals. There are much better quality grain free foods that cost less then this.",1
"Ordered OVEN ROASTED TURKEY NUGGETS*** for the first time. Meat is dry. Expiration date is too close; received today, SEPT 9, 2011, expiring NOV 21, 2011.<br /><br />In the past, have had very good experience with the Chicken Teriyaki nuggets. Jack Link's used to use dark meat. Jack Link's changed the recipe to white meat and the nuggets do not taste as rich any more.<br /><br />*** Very disappointed with Amazon's approach on linking ALL Jack Link's nuggets together. Meaning: If you post a review for the Chicken Teriyaki ones, you can NOT post one for the flaming chicken, turkey over roasted, etc.?! And the same review will show up under any and all of them. I contacted Amazon and customer service first tried to convince me I was doing something wrong. On the third e-mail, the senior CS guru indicated the nugget products are all linked together and nothing will be done about the issue.",2
"This tea is yummy!  Unlike many of their fruit flavored teas, this one has no licorice in it (yeah!).<br /><br />Smooth berry flavors, but not too strong on any one flavor.  It gets better as it sits.  It can steep for a long time and not get bitter at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended.",5
"Both steaks in The Celebration are sufficiently large, and the filet is amazing. The strip is good but not great, but can feed two.",4
"I gave this Hot Sauce one star because i love hot sauce with heat and flavor but this Mega Death is to freaking hot, So hot it has know taste it just hurts you can't even taste your food you put it on so if your looking for a good prank item buy this and sneak some into your victims food and watch there face you'll get a good laugh! PS: Don't Forget To Record The Prank & Upload The Video On YouTube.",1
". . .A little fussy about my coffee, and this coffee did not disappoint me.  It has a rich flavor, I can control the strength by adding or substracting the amount of water I use (which you can do wih all coffees, I know).  The flavor - although I cannot pinpoint the difference, is very nice.  I'll definitely be buying more of this brand and I think that's probably the best review I can give it - I want more.",5
My son takes a snack everyday and he loves the Kind Protein Bars.  They arrived very fast and a great deal!,5
NOW stevia is the best I have used so far. I use it in many things...food and drink. The only way you will get an after taste with this product is if you use too much. It takes very little to sweeten food and drinks.,5
"This Marley Coffee has a beautiful strong aroma before brewing, like fresh ground beans, I am amazed it smells so good and strong then brews up very mild, almost weak, but that sounds like a negative and that's not what I mean, I drink a lot of coffee and have for years and love a strong brew most the time, this coffee is so mild I can drink it plain. I usually like a splash of cream, or lately a dab of honey.  So I give it a four, because it may not be as strong as I like but comes in individual packets so stays fresh, portable for my frequent camping/hiking trips, brews up to a taste that can be sipped plain, and organic with a amazing pre-brew aroma.",4
"Delivery was quick. However, when it arrived the lid was completely broken even though it looked securely wrapped in bubble wrap. Very disappointed that the product was damaged.",3
"I've eaten other brands of unsalted potato chips and they've always been terrible.  I didn't expect much when I bought these.  But after I tasted them I was amazed.  I have never enjoyed unsalted potato chips before these.  They have a natural potato flavor with thick, crunchy chips.  The only bad thing is the bag is a pain to open.  Use scissors and save yourself the aggravation.",5
"It's extremely salty, and colors everything black. What does this thing have to do with caviar?<br />I bought the 2 cans but couldn't even finish one. Tried offering it to friend and after one taste, no one would want any more...",1
"I was very disappointed.  I love good cider, having grown up and gone to the mill each year.  I like most grocery store cider as well.  This stuff was really bad, tasted to me like raw chemicals.  Went through 4 or 5 people who spit it out directly.  Not my machine, they liked the tea and coffee and even ran hot water between to see if that was it.",1
"FYI Gluten-Intolerant Folks! This product contains Rye and Barley which contain gluten. The package states that the gluten is removed in the processing, but my personal experience drinking this doesn't support that claim. I am gluten-intolerant, and I reacted to Dandy Blend as if I had ingested gluten. Too bad, because it is pleasant-tasting and a nice coffee substitute!",1
What a really great product! All the flavors from this company are delicious! (I'm lucky enough to have tried them all!) The cashews are amazing quality and the recipes reeeaally pack some flavor - these are anything BUT bland! Love the convenient vacuum seal packs...prevents you from having to open a whole jar - everything stays fresh. Much better than your normal snack mix!!,5
Love this product and so do dogs! It is a big hit with all breeds and owners alike. Try it out!,5
"We have used this pan for a while.  We found that the door discourages the cats from entry so we removed the door with no problems.  The pan is great, but the postage is a killer.  I have priced these in the store and was happy to ""pay less"" on-line.  After the shipping and handling, I actually paid more than retail prices.  Tax was about the same.",4
"Dogs probably don't really want to spend most of their lives scratching, but it seems that's what they do.  After trying many foods on two dogs, Wellness has stopped that.  It must be the natural ingredients because when I've tried ""supermarket brands"" they go back to scratching again.  Thanks, but I'll just stick with this.  Coats are shiny, even after swimming and mud baths.  It's expensive compared to ""supermarket brands"" but a bargain compared to other holistic dog foods and the vet bills we used to have!  Many years ago, we started feeding it to our black lab and he showed significant improvement in a couple of days.  After he died, (he was 14) we eventually got a golden retriever pup and tried him on the cheaper food but he showed the same signs of scratching and dull coat.  We put him on Wellness and all symptoms cleared up quickly.",5
"Yummy! Perfect little candy: Not too sweet, not too tart, not too tangy. Everywhere I've brought these, and with everyone I've shared, the reviews are rave. Special treats...but plan on giving these away, because all who taste them want to keep the rest of the bag.",5
"The item description says this should contain four pieces, but I received ONE tiny .53 ounce piece of chocolate in a big box! I should have read the description better because I thought this was for the large bars, not the little pieces (my mistake). I wouldn't have paid this price--I could have bought a whole bag at BJs for what I paid for the one piece plus shipping. I have contacted the seller regarding only receiving one, not four pieces, and will revise this if I receive the rest.",1
"This is a nice light, simple, yet flavorful dressing.  I've received compliments whenever I have used it at dinner parties.  My local Safeway used to carry it--Amazon prices for a 6 pack are much better.  Can't go wrong with this!",5
"I got this in a Care Package from the Celiac Disease Center. I tried it right away because the expiration date was approaching. They were pretty easy to make and they tasted okay, but they were kind of hard - not soft like cinnamon rolls should be. I would have to need cinnamon rolls pretty badly if I were to go through the trouble to make these again. I wouldn't recommend it to my non gluten free friends for sure.",2
"The cashew cookie bar is one of the best bars i have ever eaten, especially when you look at the ingredients. It is all natural with no preservatives. you cannot make a better tasting, better for you bar. I eat these on my long runs on the weekends and they seem to sustain my energy very well. The flavors i have liked the best, of the ones i have tired, are cashew cookie, cinnamon roll, apple pie, and gingersnap.",5
the banana tastes like dirt. everything else is pretty good. most def don't eat the bananas.they should just replace the banana with mango or some other fruit.,1
"This product is wonderful.  My older Westie has always had some trouble with plaque build-up and this product really took care of it.  On top of that, both of the dogs love the flavor, its like a treat to them.  And since I don't have to clean their teeth as often, it is a treat for me as well.",5
"Our dogs love these treats, and we feel good that they might help their teeth.  These don't make them sick to their stomach like those horrible ""greenies!""",5
"I really enjoyed the cupcake mints so i thought I would try the gum as well. However, the gum didn't taste as good to me. I guess it comes down to personal taste.",3
"I'm not going to get too excited about soup in a can but if you are 1200 miles away from the soup pot, this is an acceptable alternative. I sprinkle a few fresh bacon crumbles in mine since the caned version has the flavor but lacks the texture.",4
"I bought this seasoning because I saw that it had nothing but five star ratings on here. I have made two batches so far, and it has definitely not lived up to the hype. I prepped the meat for 24 hours as instructed, then I dehydrated it for 4 hours like I usually do for jerky. The taste is OK, but it really has a meat flavor first, with a jerky aftertaste. If this is the only jerky seasoning I have ever tasted, I might like it better, but I know there's much better out there. If you want the opinion of someone who makes several pounds of jerky a week I'd suggest going with the Nesco brand of seasoning. They're messier because you have to make a marinade with them, but the flavor is fantastic, and in my opinion, unbeatable.",2
"This company advertises this as a healthy product that's good for your dog.  A quick look at the ingredients says otherwise.  True, there is no wheat gluten but there are two different types of sugars, dextrose and corn syrup listed in the top ingredients.  There is also soy protein isolate, a dubious ingredient in a food or treat for dogs, IMO.  Leaving out one bad ingredient while adding in three more isn't exactly brag-worthy!!<br /><br />On the plus side my raw fed, extremely picky dog loved this food!  This is a dog who will literally spit something out she doesn't like but she gobbled up as many as I would give her.  The fact that she will eat this treat made me give it three stars instead of two, but lets be real, this is still junk food for dogs!!  OK in moderation but it doesn't live up to the nutritional hype by the manufacturers.",3
Just got these oatmeal animal cookies and we love them!  These are not like a typical animal cracker - they are more like tiny crunchy granola bars!  They remind me of the oats and honey crunchy granola bars from Nature Valley.  Also love the price - the only place I can buy these is Whole Foods and they are .99/package there.  Subscribe and save is definitely a winner on this one!,5
"I was turned on to Vitalyte (at the time called Gookinade) by a friend and my husband and I LOVE it. I could never drink the other ""power"" drinks as they were way too sweet for my taste so I always stuck with water. After trying this drink, I am hooked! My husband who always drank Gatorade came to drink only Vitalyte after trying it. We live in the desert and now drink it on a daily basis to stay hydrated. Love the lemonade- the only flavor we buy.",5
This product is great.  I made homemade raisin filled cookies for christmas and my family loves them.  The filling tastes just like the homemade kind.  You can't buy raising pie filling in stores anymore and I don't exactly have the time to cook the raisins and make my own so I tried this product.  It's perfect.,5
"When I ordered a bouquet of pink roses to be delivered for my mother's birthday, I placed the order much later than I should have and I included in the order a special request to Spring in the Air to expedite delivery in a tight, actually unfair, time frame. I received a personal response from the company that they would make a particular effort to ship the roses in time -- from Columbia, South America to Ohio, USA! They also contacted my mother to expect the package. They kept me notified by email of the progress of the shipment. Unfortunately, due to a FedEx delay, the roses were delivered the morning after the requested delivery date. That was not the fault of Spring in the Air, who updated me several times with the delivery information. I still would consider it a lightning speed delivery.<br /><br />  When the roses arrived, my mother was ABSOLUTELY DELIGHTED! She told me there were enough roses for her to make two beautiful bouquets, and each rose was in the perfect stage of bloom and without any blemishes due to the EXQUISITE CARE the company took in packaging the flowers. She was amazed the stems on the roses were so long! They were absolutely PERFECT and FRESH cut flowers! She was so happy with them! Because they barely missed the requested delivery date, though through no fault of theirs, Spring in the Air credited the purchase price. I will certainly use this company again. I can't write a review glowing enough to express my satisfaction with my order and my pleasure in dealing with a seller that gives such terrific customer service!",5
"i've had a tassimo single-cup brewer for over a year, and this coffee is the reason. though our local starbucks seems to have changed the beans a few months ago, caffe verona tasted very close to the house coffee you get at starbucks. unfortunately, starbucks and kraft have parted ways, so starbucks will be exclusive to the keurig brand. so this would be a 1-star review for tassimo users but a 4-star review for keurig users. maybe peets' coffee will make a deal with tassimo...",3

This is one of the best snacks to come along in a long time!  I have shared them with people at work and am sending bags to my Grandkids for Christmas!,5
"Received a sample box of Ahmad English Tea in a Christmas gift basket.  When it was gone, ordered a box of 100 tea bags.  This is a nice dark and hearty tea.  And it's from England. Excellent either in the morning or for late afternoon on a winter day. Though with the shipping fee it's a bit expensive, it is worth it.  Now one of my favorite teas.  Will order again.",4
"Disclosure: I used to work at Peet's coffee, so am used to a decent cup of joe. This Jeremiah's Pick decaf reserve can compete with the best of Peet's decaf, IMHO. It has great flavor and decent crema (if you grind the beans right before brewing, as is best), plus holds up well to sugar & cream unlike many decafs out there. With the subscribe & save Jeremiah's is pretty competitive to other coffees out there. The cost, combined with the taste & quality, make it a very appealing coffee. I really hated switching to decaf at first, but it now it's not bad at all because of Jeremiah's Pick decaf reserve. I've been drinking it for months now and will continue to do so until...well, until I can't anymore. It's really good!",5
"Just got my order in today. I unpacked it and went to put them in my cupboard, and I discovered 8 dented cans. 8 out of 12! 5 of them were severely dented. The Amazon packaging was fine and it was in a larger box with other items which were not damaged, so it was packaged like that at the manufacturer. I was hoping the bad reviews from last year were fixed but I guess not. These cans were from Thailand (not Sri Lanka) so atleast they fixed that issue. I'm most likely going to find a different brand after this!<br /><br />Amazon of course is amazing and they already have a replacement shipment on the way. Hopefully they checked it before it left and I don't get anymore dented cans!",1
This is the third or fourth time we've hit up an Amazon Grocery sale to get these cheap.  Not too many are broken and the price is good!,5
"Exactly as listed--bottles look the same, same size, etc.  Smells good out of the bottle (unlike the weird artificial vanillas).  Price is great for what you are getting: real vanilla.",5
"I'm normally a coffee (espresso) drinker.  This is a great alternative, made warm, it's filling and flavorful on a cool/cold day.  Cold, it's better (less 'muddy') than Lipton for iced-tea.  It's that classic English Breakfast taste.  Not too much caffeine, I drink this all day long (mostly as hot tea in the winter).",4
"I had rescued a Maltipoo at 7 weeks old. This puppy was a hot mess. I was not prepared for puppy and Fromm is not sold where I live. So, I bought Blue Buffolo puppy food. The dog was not eating and and the vet and I were doing all kinds of things to get her to eat.<br /><br />I already feed Fromm to all my other fur family so when I got home that night from buying supplies and picking her up at the vet. I ordered Fromm puppy.<br /><br />She loves it! I am confident that she will be a happy and healthy dog and this will be partially due to her steady diet of Fromm.<br /><br />No. I do not have any affiliation to this company. I do see the results of what their good food has on my pets.<br /><br />I also like it is an American company that is actually making it's food in America and not outsourcing to other countries like China.",5
"This product is marketed as a dinner or soup, and I can see how some people would be put off by it when consumed this way. Instead, I use it as a sauce for baked chicken. Simply lay out some drumsticks in a casserole dish, pour Kitchens of India Ready To Eat Mirch Ka Salan over the chicken (one package for every 6 drumsticks), cover and bake at 350 degrees for about an hour. Everyone who has tried it wants the recipe. They are always amazed at how simple this is to make.",5
"Great service, well packed and no damage dispite UPS trying so hard to destroy the box. Will order again!The items were in good shape as they were each packed in bubble wrap",5
"We have several cats, one of which has had a vomiting problem for many years.  We tried many cats food.  Science diet sensitive is one of the foods that works.  There are 2 otherss.  1 is Purina 1 Sensitive which is also great.  the other is a Royal Canin Oral Sensitive.  I think the Science Diet and the Purina 1 are the best.  We also give the cat Prednisolone under a Vet prescription, as the vet said it was inflamatory bowel disease.",5
I've tried several varities of Green Mountain K-cups of coffee.  Without a doubt this is the best.  Over the years I had coffee many places in the world but the Double Black Diamond is amoung the best.  I highly recommend if you like a strong cup of coffee without being bitter.,5

"Great flavor, and texture.  It may not be the best jerky out there, but for the price, I couldn't find any better.  It comes in a few different flavors, so there's bound to be one you like.  I just wish the shelf life was longer, I'd love to keep this with the emergency food/water.",5
"The Lamb Jerky soft treats are the first product we tried from Zuke's.  They were a big hit and continue to be one of my little schnoodle's favorite treats.<br />Soft jerky squares (approx 1"") can easily be split into 3-4 pieces.  We use them for her training/play sessions and she seems to especially love it when the reward is the Zuke's soft lamb jerky.<br />Although she performs just as eagerly when the reward is the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00292BM7C"">Zuke's 16-Ounce Mini Bakes Dog Treats, Peanut Butter n' Blueberryz</a> or the Zuke's Mini Bakes Chicken n' Cherry.

"I do subscription-based purchase. So far I received 3 shipments from Amazon. With first shipment, the cap attachment on two boxes popped out, and water leaked, and I had to throw those boxes away. Second shipment was OK. Third shipment has one box with cap attachment popped out and most of water from the box was leaked.<br /><br />I do the subscription-based purchase for convenience, but considering having to throw away 1 or 2 boxes out of 12-box carton is not good. Looking for alternative brand.",2
"i thought i ordered rice and beans, however, i ended up with a case of garbanzos",5
Product arrived on time and in great condition.  Nothing was bent.  My dog loves this food!,5
"I haven't experienced any of the pod issues, but I'm only three pods into the box. My review is on the flavor of this coffee. The description claim is that it is a ""Flavor match to Coffee People Jet Fuel. Tasty, full-bodied, smoky blend."" This stuff tastes nothing like Jet Fuel. Even though the ""best by"" date on the box is 02/13 this stuff tastes old and stale to me. Unfortunately I bought two boxes so I'll muddle through, but then I'll be going back to either Jet Fuel or Black Tiger. If you're a fan of either one of those, fuhgeddabout Fuhgeddaboutit and stick with your fav.",1
"This tea is tasty and refreshing. And, buying it through Amazon makes it VERY affordable!",5
Since the temperature is rising and summer officially seems to have arrived I've been keeping bottles of water in the refrigerator. By mixing in a packet of this delicious drink mix you can make water a little more exciting. I love the tart flavor and don't think it is overly sweet like some of the other mixes I've tried. With other flavors I was using half the packet at a time in a 16.9-ounce bottle of water. With raspberry lemonade I'm using the entire packet. What I really love about this mix is the hint of floral flavors. It is difficult to describe but it makes the drink a little more exotic. To be honest this is one of the best drinks I've ever tasted. I'll be buying more!<br /><br />~The Rebecca Review,5
"Choo Choo R Snacks Chiptole Habanero Country Cut Beef Jerky is by far the best store bought beef jerky I've tasted!  I love thick cut beef jerky - and the spicier, the better!  They score a AAA+++ from me.<br /><br />USPS really messed up on my shipment of this item, but Choo Choo sent me extra, as an apology for a slow delivery - something they really did not need to do.  Choo Choo is tops in my book!  From a disabled Vietnam Vet, a big THANK YOU!!<br /><br />Alan Hoffman<br />Wyoming",5
"Sizzle sticks were said to be odor free, and they are, so I'm rating them 5 stars. I can't attest to how much my dog liked them because he expressed no interest in them, but I wouldn't fault the sticks for this. He's elderly, a very finicky eater and not a chewer. I thought i'd give these a try, but will leave it to others to report on them. (I think most experienced dog owners know that what appeals to some dogs, doesn't appeal to others, so I would never fault a product on that basis).",5
My cats eat every single piece of this food! All 3 of them love it and I have given it to other cats besides my own and they all gobble it up as well. I recommend this to people who have kitties who aren't feeling well or eating very much because they will usually gobble this up no matter what!,5
"I get these at Walmart (in the Asian food section) for .49 cents each. I absolutely LOAD UP on them. They are like any other raman noodle in that you boil water, add raman and cook for a min or two until your degree of doneness. Then you drain as much water as you prefer, which I personally drain most of it. I leave just enough to still have `soup' water after the noodles soak/cool. Every package also comes with three additions. One is a packet of paste, much like curry pastes if you use them. You have to cut an end off and really squish and squeeze the paste into your bowl of cooked noodles. Then the other packet has two sides. One is full of tasty spices and herbs. I use both of these packets and my noodles are plenty spicy. There is also a side packet of Chili powder if you like your food really hot. I have learned to leave this packet out because I enjoy the slightly spiciness (a slow warming of body temp, not a burning in your mouth) rather than full-blown heat. You can try it either way!<br /><br />The image on the front does have shrimp on it. Well, these have zero flavor of shrimp. It's more of a spicy heat and kind of fruity notes, and of course raman...quality raman by the way.<br /><br />I would give these a dozen stars.  A quick, easy meal with two packets or a snack with one. Loads of flavor, of course it's high in sodium. You could make the soup then drain all of the broth to get rid of some sodium.<br /><br />HIGHLY recommended!<br /><br />Sheri Gill",5
"dudes, you can't argue that there's some iconic sh** in this flick.  the characters are all killer, winona rocks in her day, and the b-juice is one of the ultiimate onscreen personas of all time.  wicked.  funny.  the scenes in the death waiting room are a scream.  for an old flick, this is good eatin.  i'm out.  j.",5
"Lapsang Souchong tea is difficult to find, and it is an acquired taste, but I love its smoky flavor - Lapsang Souchong has more character than regular black tea, and it conjures up visions of sitting by a roaring fire on a cold winter's afternoon with a good book.  If you have never tried it before, you might not want to order this much, but if you have experienced Lapsang Souchong before, or if you're feeling bold and want to try something a bit rarer than Lipton's, I highly recommend it.",4
"My 9mo old loves these. They are quite airy and delicious too, perfect exception to the ever present cheerios snack. Love that they're organic and made of decent ingredients.",5
"Very quick and easy to prepare.<br />Looks appetizing when served.<br />More than enough for one person if used as a side dish.<br />Tastes and looks homemade, can see tomato pieces in sauce.<br />Doesn't taste or look like the average microwaved dish.<br />Nutrition panel is not too horrendous, compared to other processed dishes.<br />On a personal note, I found it a bit salty.<br />Extremely convenient for keeping onhand.",4
"The Keurig storage drawer is a perfect match for the coffee maker, the coffee machine sits perfectly on the top and makes getting the refills soooo easy.<br />I looked at other storage options but I found this to be Ideal. Really glad I bought it.",5
"About three months ago, I started feeding EVO Turkey & Chicken formula to my Westie, who has a very sensitive digestive system.  He is doing extremely well on this food.  No more vomiting or loose stools.  I have tried several different brands, all very high quality foods and have had the best results with EVO.<br />I would highly recommend giving it a try.",5

"Dixie, our golden retriever, who's usually a picky eater, gobbles up the Purina Chef Michael's Dog Food"" in seconds. She seems to love the smell, taste and texture of the grilled sirloin steak flavors and potato and green bean garnishes.<br />The 4.5 pound Chef Michael's package label says it ensures the adult dog food has 100% complete and balanced nutrition. The ingredients is real beef as the protein and vegetables as garnishes. The tender beef pieces and crunchy kibbles include twenty-three essential vitamins and minerals and no artificial preservatives.<br />Dixie and I wholeheartedly recommend the Chef Michael's dog food for a well-rounded, tasty meal with premier ingredients.",5
"Okay so this cereal is like candy for breakfast except it's not candy... it's rice krispies treats. I can't even begin to explain how boss this is and how much this has blown my mind. Forget filling pinatas with pens, I'm filling them with rice krispies treats cereal.",5
"Very unique and flavorful gummies. They don't have the texture or the chew of Haribo, but they are very good in their own right. For the price you really can't go wrong.",4
"I love that this cocoa is all natural and has added health benefits.  I sprinkle it on almost anything I can - pancake, waffle, oatmeal, etc. Just wish it wasn't so pricey for the amount you get.",5
"I first tried this tea when my local grocery store had it at Christmas time. I went back and bought a ton of it because it immediately became my favorite tea. I love the peppermint & ginger and I love the fresh new bud taste of white tea, over green tea leaves (Same plant, different part). This tea has it all. Mildly spicy, and smooth yet refreshing. I practically live on herbal teas and have tried lots of different ones. This is my number one all time favorite!",5
"This is a great salt; it has a wholesome flavor and, I noticed it doesn't make you thirsty or rise the blood pressure as regular salt does. That's the benefit of the natural balance of minerals in it. I would recommend this to friends and health conscious people.",5
"Lawry's Mesquite Lime marinade is, in my opinion, the perfect addition to anything. Pork, beef, chicken, fish, and even veggies. It is bold and savory and just the right hint of tang from the lime. Unfortunately, it is extremely difficult to find these days on the grocery shelves. The price offered for a six pack here on Amazon is very reasonable though - so I recommend stocking up because it is highly addictive!",5
"I have to start off by noting that I am not a fan of packaged or jar forms of baby food. Fresh and homemade is my preference.<br /><br />But having noted that, Baby Gourmet is a winner and the major plus for us is that it is so portable and light. Each pouch is only 4.5 ounces and a pouch or two is all that is needed for even a relatively long day trip, although you'll probably want to bring along some extra snacks from the other food groups.  Depends on how long you'll be gone. Even the standard box of 12 is simple to tote along.<br /><br />Of course, any baby food has to pass the taste test and the Pear and Garden Greens was eaten eagerly, not only by a baby but a pouch was consumed by an older child (poured over some sliced bananas). So it will be  a staple for a 6 month old and a snack for the older child - when carrying along homemade food isn't possible.<br /><br />Unlike baby food in jars, young fingers can grasp the Baby Organic package, although parental supervision may be necessary to help aim the spout into the mouth. Of course, you can always squeeze the puree out of the pouch and into a bowl and serve it that way.<br /><br />Baby Gourmet doesn't need refrigeration until opened and an entire box isn't the least bit heavy. A shelf stable product is a major advantage when refrigerator space is at a premium. It always is at our home.<br /><br />Since Baby Gourmet encourages parents to taste the product, I did. It was appealing and not overly sweet. This made sense because the Pear and Garden Greens is noted to be unsweetened. I could definitely taste both vegetable and fruit flavors and to my adult taste buds it had a slightly sweet but mild flavor.<br /><br />It didn't knock my socks off but I'm not the important user here...the baby is. He loved it! We did taste test this on a friend's baby. Also a success. She plans to get more Baby Gourmet as her baby is normally a picky eater.<br /><br />What about nutrition? Each pouch has 80 calories (40 per half pouch) and hefty amounts of Vitamin A and C. The package needs to be refrigerated and thrown out after 24 hours, presumably because of the lack of preservatives. There are also no fillers or thickeners and this seems safe for those babies who are prone to allergies...no gluten, nuts, dairy, egg, lactose, etc. The packaging is BPA free. It also meets the USDA and other organizations' standards for being an organic product.<br /><br />Maybe I didn't look hard enough (and would appreciate the info if anyone else has it) but I couldn't find a recyclable symbol on the individual pouches. Does anyone know if they can be recycled? I assume the cardboard box can be recycled. I am knocking one star off because I wish the recycling info was more prominent. I'm winging it on that and not putting the pouches into our recycle container. Odd as it may seem, we have had packages of other foods which have a similar plastic feel and appearance and which ARE recyclable.<br /><br />One tip: Pay attention to the expiration date as the new box I received notes that the product expires in July - and this is May. I'm actually comforted by the fact that Baby Gourmet doesn't last for months and months because many baby foods which do have added preservatives and chemicals. The list of ingredients is relatively short: organic pear, broccoli, spinach, Vitamin C, Lemon Juice. Only the lemon juice is in concentrate form.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this product for convenience, portability, ease of storage and nutritional value. We'll still primarily make baby food used but this is a wonderful option when we can't have our own on hand.",5
"I'm not a huge fan of flavored coffees because they rarely if ever name all the ingredients used in the product. Gevalia Dark Chocolate Truffle is finely ground coffee and a tasty dessert coffee. I found it works best in a French press. It's the kind of coffee to have around for guests, holidays or celebratory occasions. Due to those with various food allergies, I wish the FDA made it MANDATORY for companies to name ALL the ingredients in their products. If you're a fan of flavored coffee and like chocolate, you may want to try this. It's the best chocolate coffee I've tried to date. It has a rich, delicate flavor without using any milk, cream or sugar. Happy Holidays.",4
"I have tried many of the Gluten Free mixes and flours and Pamela's if by FAR the best of the 'bunch.'  If you find a better product, I'd really like to hear about it.  For now, I've decided that Pamela's is the best I can do - almost as good as wheat flour products.  lrc",5
"After trying this chicken and rice dish, I was quite impressed at how flavorful it tasted. It's certainly not better than my mother's ""Arroz con Pollo"", but it comes close. Best of all, it takes half the time to prepare since everything but the chicken (and some cooking wine) is included in the box. It makes for a quick delicious meal.",5
I've ordered the Dubble Bubble Gum Party Box twice and both times they sent me Bazooka Gum which I don't like. Do you think they'd do any thing about it after numerous calls - NOT! Amazon needs to stop carrying them with their poor customer service and can't seem to send the customer what they ordered.,1

"I ordered Mrs. Weiss' Kluski noodles, and got a whole box of New Mills Kluski Noodles, the picture in the order looks right, and it says New Mill by Mrs. Weiss in the picture but what I have is totally different.  The noodles are thinner than what I have purchased before, and the company should at least get the picture right.  Grr, I hope they are good because I am stuck with 12 packages of what I DID NOT ORDER, and I cannot return.",1
"We have a Beaba and I used it for all my 3 year old granddaughter's food when she was younger.  Now I am using the same one for my 5 month old grandson. I just noticed some complaints about the hollow handle getting caked with grime. I wash it immediately after use and run the faucet water through the handle. My handle is spotless inside. It has never had any grime in it. I love it and it has gotten a lot of use and still works wonderfully. I have used just about every fruit and vegetable in it without any problem. Both children have never had jarred baby-food and let's face it, there is no comparison between jarred food and home made, especially when it comes to taste.",5
Our Mini Schnauzer puppy loves these. The size is good. It lasts several days. He does have other chew toys and sticks but seems to like these best. Although they are a little pricey I think they are better than plain rawhide.,5
"After reading all the great reviews, I optimistically ordered some of this tea. I've had problems with sinus congestion very often this winter and have tried all kinds of remedies with little success.  Unfortunately, this really didn't do anything for me.  The taste is OK (bearable), but it did nothing to relieve my sinus congestion.  (So far the only things I've found that have helped me somewhat are the Vicks personal warm mist humidifier and Neti Xlear)",2
"Delicious!  Great for lunches or an anytime snack.  Would definitely buy again.  All natural without the sugary, crunchy, artificial taste of normal banana chips.  Even my 2 year old grandson loves them!  Highly recommended!",5
"This is the best food for my poodles.  Great for their eyes as well as their curly coats.  I have noticed a big difference around the eyes where there was weeping and staining.  They love it.  It must be good, the cat even eats it.  Best to buy the 10 lb. bag.  Resealable ziplock top keeps it fresh for the whole month.",5
"Our vet said our Morkie needed to chew more to lose his baby teeth. I got him the Jumbones hoping they would help. The package clearly states 2 out of 3 dogs love them. I got the 1 who doesn't :-(<br /><br />Also, I think he needs something harder than this to chew the way the vet wants so his baby teeth fall out.",2
Pods work great. Quick delivery. Cheaper than the grocery store PLUs the grocery store did not have the decaf!,5
This is the best quality polish product I miss so much being here in US. But I realized that I can buy it via amazon. I highly recommend the seller. Transaction was smooth and shipping was very fast!! Great deal!!,5
"Okay.  I admit it. I was a little leary when I discovered Aspen had an egg nog mix.  I love their cider, but egg nog is another thing entirely.  Guess what?  It was great!  I mixed it with Lactaid and it tasted wonderful.  I can also vouch for combining the egg nog mix, milk, vanilla ice cream, and ice in a blender to make a smoothie/shake.",5
"I have tasted one too many different mustards which claim to be spicy, but fall short.  This spreads easy and is neither too thick, nor too thin.  It actually does have enough heat to taste, without being excessive.  This mustard would make a great addition to any sauces, marinades, salad dressings, or just for dipping!  I would recommend this product, for anyone who is looking for a mustard with some true heat.",5
"The gumballs look great in our new gumball machine, but unfortunately neither my husband and I nor the children enjoy the taste very much.",2
"I like these treats, but I usually buy them at Walmart for much less than this price.  If you want delivery, try Russell Stover's website.  They have this item for $1.99 each plus shipping, which would seem to be better than a pack of 12 for 39.99 plus shipping.  I don't know what Stover charges for shipping because I had to give then a credit card number before they would tell me.",5
I had a craving for strawberry cake with strawberry icing & saw this. At first the price stopped me but I ordered it anyway. Came well packed & fast. The taste is fresh & good. The only thing I think I would have liked better is if the cake wasn't so dense but I don't think it can't be anyway else because it is being shipped. I think next time I'll try to make it myself & see if the cake is lighter.,3
I have two Pot Bellied Pigs and they just love these treats. And I don't worry about giving them these snacks because they are so low in fat. You have no idea how fast pigs gain weight!,5
Item received quickly.  Very satisfied with price would recommend to family and friends.  Can't find this in any of my local stores.  Only order online.  A ++++++++,5
"So i'm dieting and I wanted to try the pancakes because they are advertised as low cal, good for you stuff. Like for the whole mix, 90 calories. Cool. Except to actually make the pancakes, it is now 190. And the mixture tastes like flour and water! I couldn't do it, I had to add sugar. Which totally defeats the purpose of these pancakes. Also, the bag of mix is extremely small. You can make 2 batches of little size pancakes with it. Stupid.",2
"This was recommended to us from a friend at weight watchers as a lower fat peanut butter alternative. It works very nicely for that: Mix with water and you've got yourself a spreadable peanut-butter that's much lower in fat and pretty satisfying.  But we've also used it a couple other ways that have been fantastic.<br /><br />Making chocolate covered peanut butter balls (Buckeyes): Use some of this instead of powdered sugar to increase the peanut flavor and reduce the oversweetness of some recipes.<br /><br />Take a teaspoon of it and add to chocolate ice cream.  It's excellent.<br /><br />This is a great product not only as a low fat peanut butter option, but also for many different desert recipes (and maybe some non-desert recipes).",5
while no junk food or snack food is actually good for us...this one comes close to being satisfying for a salty snack with lots of  cheesy taste but without the strange ingredients of the other popular cheese puff brands.  I like them.  Light and they  do not upset the system with additives and colorings.  A little too addictive with all the salt but if you can be disciplined this is a good alternative when you simply must have something crunchy and salty to eat.  I would buy them again.  No orange fingers and no weird carb feeling after eating them.,4
It allowed me to get what was not in the stores. More expansive then the stores but at least I got it.,3
"I love the fact that these pretzels come in 100 calorie packs. It is just the right amount for an afternoon snack. We have a bunch of pretzels, peanuts, almonds, etc. on a snack table at work. Around 2:30 every afternoon my resolve to stay away from the salty, filling (and fattening) yummy goodness on the table would start to wane. By 2:32 I would be coming up with reasons to hover around the snack table. By 2:40 I'd be covered in peanut shells, done with my feeding frenzy and figuring out how I was going to avert a repeat performance tomorrow. Then I found Snyder's of Hanover 100 Calorie packs. Seriously, folks, they are my saving grace. And they have just the right amount of salt. I thought 60 bags would be a ridiculous amount if pretzels to purchase, but it worked out great, they lasted a couple of months and I've already purchased another box.",5
"This is not like any kettle corn I ever had before. It is very sweet, without a hint of salt. It should be called glazed sugar popcorn. I will not buy this again.",2
"Based on the reviews, I purchased these lollies to give to my customers even though I had never actually tasted them.  I sell natural beauty products so, I thought they would be a good fit for my boutique.  Well, they are very yummy and my customers can't get enough.  I swear I've had a couple of customers come back in just for these.  Because of popularity, I had to increase my subscription from three months to one month just to keep them on hand.  What I like about them is that they all have full flavor which is unexpected from candy that does not have any artificial flavors.",5
"These pockets are the only thing that helps our beagle take his allergy medication.  Otherwise, he spits the pill out.  His pill is small enough that I can break the pockets in half and use half for one pill.  They are expensive-but great!",4
"I had heard about some kind of juice being good for relieving gout symptoms, but I didn't follow up on it.  Now the FDA has given one, and only one, pharmaceutical company the monopoly on colchicine and so the price is going up something like fifty fold.  Yep, a ten cent pill will now cost five bucks.  Colchicine is made from the ground up stamens of Autumn Crocus flowers and was first developed by the ancient Egyptians.  People have been taking it for gout for centuries.  Fooking FDA.  Well, it turns out that it is black cherry juice that is good at relieving gout symptoms.<br /><br />There are several choices at Amazon, I think this one, the pint of concentrate from Dynamic Health for $7.63 is the best deal.  I have a Vitamin Shoppe nearby that sells their house brand for the same amount and I believe that their's is made by Dynamic Health too.  It's good stuff and I do believe it is helping with the gout.  I've been drinking black cherry juice for a couple of weeks.  I use two table spoons in 8 oz of water to make a glass.<br />The first week I was drinking a couple of glasses a day, by the second week I'm down to a glass every couple of days.  I haven't had any gout flares since I started drinking black cherry juice and I'm convinced it has helped.  I still have a few aches that I know are gout related, but no flares.  Now if I could cut back on beer and get some exercise even the aches might go away but......beer, mmmmm beer.<br /><br />Some people have said that they don't like the taste of this particular brand.  Taste like cherries to me but if you want something that taste ""better"" that pretty much leaves Knudsen and that brand cost considerably more.  As I stated above, I think that The Vitamin Shoppe brand is actually made by Dynamic Health.  I give it 5 stars, Knudsen may taste better, but at this price this is a fine choice.",5
"I ordered this coffee and another brand, it seems, about three weeks ago.  I checked this morning, February 8,  and found the deliver is out into March or Apri.

This was a wonderful addition for Christmas Tea time. It is not like the usual American fruit cake.  This was  Delicious with Marzipan &  icing on top. The Recipe is as they have used in Europe for many years. Next  year ordering more.,5
I love this chocolate! It's with erythritol too which is PERFECT for someone on the candida-diet. My favorite flavor is Raspberry chocolate...,5
"This is a great cereal.  It has more sugar than some people might like, but if you have a sweet tooth it's good to know that you're eating real sugar and not HFCS.  Even then, it's only 12g--much less than many cereals on the market.  I think the 4g protein and 5g fiber more than make up for it.  On top of that, every box has a coupon for a free Fruit Naturals fruit cup ($1.59 value at my local grocery store).  Very good value, overall.",5
"These are great bars.  Tastey, filling and no crash from HFCS.  I recommend highly.<br /><br />Be aware that the coating does melt if it gets too warm, so keeping in the purse in August will yeild a slightly smeary snack.  If you plan to travel with them, make sure they stay cool.",5
"Ive tried every bar, these are BEST. Just the right amount of protein, fat, carbs, sugar, everything. They have a wafer like texture like an ice cream cone. awesome. Vanilla and cookies and cream are the best. i don't like cinnamon roll much.",5
bought these at costco for a few cents less and figure they will either double in price or never be in stock again glad to know they are here on amazon  They ARE addictingly good..the deep dark chocolate flavor is haunting.  I was looking for choc cherries but these will do nicely,5

Hands down the best popcorn you can make at home. I am convinced that the 8 oz antique popcorn cart that i purchased has paid for itself 5 times over with the savings of staying home to watch movies and have fresh popcorn at an arms reach. I hope you guys stay in business for a long time!,5
"If these little cookies were organic they would get 5 stars plus, but alas they are not.  They are extra sweet with only 60 calories per bar, mostly from concentrated fruit juices.  They do have a definite raspberry taste and I'm a sucker for ""anything raspberry""!<br /><br />We are not gluten sensitive but do not eat wheat. I bought them because they contain no wheat or refined sugar and the price on Amazon is very good.  I just wish Barbara's bakery would change to organic ingredients because they make such tasty treats.<br /><br />All that said, two bars and a nice big glass of soy or almond milk make for a satisfied evening tummy! (They're good with coffee or tea too.)",4
"Simon, about 7 years old has some kind of adversity to most foods and throws up shortly after eating canned or dry cat food and nearly died from, can you believe, bronchitis? ...2 years ago. We have gone through many foods, dry and canned until I found Holistic Select canned cat food(He gets the Salmon or Ocean Fish). He loves it...and does NOT throw it up!!! ...even tho he only gets about 2-3 teaspoons morning and night and not a lot of dry, 2 x's day. He somehow still manages to weigh 14 pounds.<br /><br />Bella, a mostly gray with white chest and paws, about 10 years old would most likely fit within the widest part of a 16 oz soda bottle, in other words she is soooo skinny ...and might I mention FINICKY!  Her biggest nick name is Princess. She ""cautiously"" walks up to a new food I put down, sniff's it and IF she likes it, adjusts her sitting position, sometimes moving to a different angle before she slowwwly starts nibbling. She USUALLY does NOT like them and has this look on her face that says ""You've GOT to be kidding me if you think I will EAAAAT THAAAAT!!!!! EWWWWWW!!!"". She stands back up, shakes her paw and glances at me as she runs/hops off like a deer into the woods. Bella IS the reason I tried the Holistic Select. When I put the HS down for her, my eyes nearly popped out of my head. She QUITE eagerly, without hesitation or any adjustment to her seating spot or angle dove in as if she had not eaten in a week or more. She will only eat the Salmon or Ocean Fish. I have tried the Duck and the turkey and ""no way!"" I would so like for her to gain at least one pound! I think she still weighs about SIX pounds and eats as much as a fly. To make sure she is the only one eating her food, I bought her a bird cage ""dining room"". She is the only one of the three cats that fits thru the entrance.<br /><br />Then there's Bob, a brown tabby! What about Bob is what we always say. Bob doesn't run from much and eats more than he runs from. The least picky, doesn't throw up and is, like Simon about 7 years old. They're best buds, btw. (Bob also nearly died about 2 years ago from liver disease.) Usually, Bob quietly hangs out by his bowl near the stove, tripping us or getting stepped on. Knowing he is going to get HS, he has frequently becomes quite vocal in anticipation of his ""Happy"" meal.<br /><br />I, THE cats so recommend trying Holistic Select. Petco, when they kept it ON their shelves, sold it for $2.49 a can(even if you buy a case of it!). They said they did not sell enough for them to stock it and encouraged me to order it thru their website. I always have to ""shop around"" and found it on Amazon for $1.90 a can. I'm IN and Petco is losing OUT! (Initially, I would encourage buying a can, if you can find it at petco to see if your cat will eat it. They will order some for you but u have to check back &lt;they don't call you when it arrives!>, they just put it on the shelf and it disappears FAST). Once you know it's good to go, order online. If you do the Prime shipping thing on Amazon, most everything you buy is shipped free.<br /><br />Merry Christmas!<br />~Yvonne",5
"tastes ok, but i would get black tea with lemon next time for a little more flavor.",3
"This Keurig cup is very tasty.  It isn't quite as strong as I would like, but Green Mountain does advertise it as a light brew. I place it on the strongest setting in my coffee maker and am very happy with the result.",4
"I have a small single cup coffee maker for those times when I need a quick cup of coffee but don't want a whole pot.  All right, that doesn't happen very often - I can usually handle a whole pot.  But when I want a quick cup, I don't want to be grinding beans, getting out a filter and going through all the same steps as making a whole pot.  These filter packs are the perfect solution at a great price!  The coffee is almost as good as Starbucks for a fraction of the price.",5
"I've tried a few different brands of extra-virgin coconut oil, and for the most part I'm equally satisfied with them all. Despite the marketing hype, coconut oil brands within each category (virgin, refined, hydrogenated) are very similar. I should specify the qualities I look for in a coconut oil: I want a coconut oil with a rich coconut aroma and taste, maximum nutrition, and minimal processing. For these reasons, I always select an organic, extra-virgin, cold-pressed oil.<br /><br />I'm pleased that this Nutiva Organic Extra-Virgin Coconut Oil provides these qualities along with an easy-to-find ""packed on"" and ""best before"" date. The jars I ordered in late January 2011 were packed on September 13, 2010, and the ""best before"" date is September 13, 2012. Stored correctly (cool, dark location, no refrigeration needed), this nutrient-dense oil stays fresh for two years. It smells and tastes great--coconutty and slightly sweet.<br /><br />According to Nutiva, no hexane is used in the processing of this oil. Hexane is a petroleum-derived solvent used in all kinds of industrial applications, from shoe manufacturing to roofing. Interestingly, because hexane's primary molecular structure is carbon, it can be passed off as ""organic."" Do a little research; ""cold-pressed,"" ""organic,"" AND ""hexane-free"" are key considerations when selecting your coconut oil for nutrition purposes.<br /><br />I'm not as pleased with the plastic jars. In fact, I took off a star as a result of the plastic packaging. I feel that a quality organic oil should be stored in a glass jar, and ideally a dark one to reduce oxidation. I've actually selected coconut oils specifically because they come in glass jars, and might have bypassed this product if I hadn't found it on sale at a good price. I put this information in the review to aid those of you who are looking for a coconut oil in a glass jar. Great deals can be found on Amazon, by the way, especially if you purchase the packs of two jars.",4
Stuff was great! Used it in lip balm that I created for x-mas presents. Will be ordering this stuff again!,5
"This is s great coffee if you are into espresso based drinks. the price...unbelievable, much less than i would pay in a store (if I could find it in a store around here). and with setup shipping every few weeks, i don't even have to think about it...you come home from work, and there it is, waiting to be enjoyed...",5
"I was utterly excited when I saw this item and it certainly did not disappoint. It's not too sweet and the the mint undertones were perfect. The chocolate taste was also not overpowering, but you could certainly taste it.<br /><br />I added around 4 teaspoons to a cup of heated soymilk that I had heated in the microwave. It was delicious and I personally think that the soymilk helps compliments the flavors. I haven't tried regular milk since we don't usually have that in our fridge.<br /><br />I also attempted to mix this with milo, with soymilk of course. Two teaspoons of milo and two of this product had a richer chocolate taste, but the peppermint taste was still there. I prefer this one versus just the 4 teaspoons of peppermint mocha latte.<br /><br />Oh and did I mention the wonderful foam? It's absolutely splendid and it doesn't disappear after a few minutes.<br /><br />I have yet to add this to coffee, but I definitely plan to once I start drinking coffee again. I'm sure that a teaspoon or two will help brighten my day up in the morning.<br /><br />As for the cost, it's on the pricier side for me, especially since one 7.1 oz can doesn't seem to last a long time if you only use this mixed with water/milk. With 4 teaspoons per cup, I can maybe manage about 10 cups. It has a much higher value if you simply mix a teaspoon or two to hot chocolate or coffee since I can still get the same flavor, but enhanced with the taste of coffee or more chocolate. I might pick this up at my local store, but I can't see myself buying 4 cans of this at this price. While it can go a long way, I'd rather buy one can to last me during the holidays.",4
"I make Stash Premium Decaf Raspberry & White sun tea to drink iced during the warmer months. I make a half gallon at a time and add a quarter cup of sugar and store it in the fridge to drink through the week. The raspberry adds good flavor to the mild white tea. It's also good hot, but I prefer it iced. I get this once a year through the Super Saver program at Amazon which I'm very happy with as it's simple and saves me money. Since I drink a lot of tea, it's a good value.",5
"I was so excited to learn about Mini Pops! They taste just like popcorn, but they're crunchier and nothing gets stuck in your teeth. I ordered over the phone and everyone was so helpful and friendly. I can't wait to try all the rest of the flavors. I couldn't recommend it more highly!",5
"Since I haven't been able to find a recipe I like, tried Johnny'a and it is awesome!  A little pricey but worth it",5
"This is the wondeful white popcorn we ate in Iowa years ago! I am so glad to find it. And what a great price too!<br />I got it today and popped some right away. I used the microwave popcorn bowl I bought from Amazon, put a tablespoonful of extra virgin olive oil and two tablespoonsful of the popcorn in the bowl.<br />I placed the bowl, with lid on, in the MW and turned it on for 1 minute and then pushed the popcorn button to pop it.<br />After moving the popped corn to another bowl I shook the shaker with the popcorn seasoning several times and oh what a delicious hulless treat! The hulls seem to have vanished during the popping. I felt nor found any.<br />AND ALL OF THE ITEMS I USED, INCLUDING THE MICROWAVE, I BOUGHT FROM AMAZON.",5
"The ingredients on this dog food say it all - corn and chicken by-product are the first ingredients. This is not what dogs were meant to eat, and I ordered this through Vine before reading the ingredient list. I like to have backup dog food in case we run out, and suprisingly my dog loved this.<br /><br />Many people say you shouldn't switch a dog's food quickly because their stomach won't adjust. I tend to feed my dog a combniation of a raw diet (raw meat, chicken, vegetables) and all natural dog foods from bags or cans.<br /><br />I did notice that my dog tended to have very runny poop after eating this, so I've stopped giving it to her more than one meal per week, and use it as emergency backup only.<br /><br />Dogs, like people, were meant to eat real food, mainly plants and meat...not this stuff. I gave it 3 stars because she liked it and ate it in its entirety, and I think it's like most conventional dog food available.",3
"If you love almonds - especially Blue Diamond Almonds, these are great!  It is like Blue Diamond Almonds on steroids.  They are not incredibly spicy, but they have a little zip and a good amount of flavor.  A better buy than the Habanero BBQ ones for sure.  I would buy them again and they are great with a cold beer.",5
"I've tried quite a few coffees and many end up tasting the same. However, this and the Italian Blend by Timothy's are two that are very good black or with cream/sugar. If you're looking for a simple coffee without all the flavors, this is the one for you.",5
This granola is crunchy and full of texture.  You won't even be able to tell this product is gluten-free.,5
"There are a few things that I look for in a bottled drinking water.  One is oxygenation which a few bottled water companies put out.  Pente water is my favorite of this kind (and has stabilized medicinal grade oxygen).  Oxygen tends to alkalize.  Two is a Ph balanced water.  Essentia is my favorite one of these.  I find that I drink the whole bottle very quickly, because it satisfies a need.  The body likes the balance that it gives.  It helps rehydrate and for the body to remove toxins.  One of the curious ways that this shows up is that when I drink a ph balanced water, I tend to go to the bathroom very soon afterwards (and you can tell from the urine color and from how much the urine ""bubbles"" that it is removing toxins).  It seems to move through the body quicker.  When my father needed to alkalize, I had recommended that he take Pente water.  But he could not find it where he was and he stumbled on Essentia water and found it worked for him and got similar results to Pente water.  I got a bottle of the Essentia water from the Amazon review program partly because it had worked for my father.  I could taste the difference, taste the minerals that made it more alkaline.  It felt slightly thicker than regular water and slightly smoother.  I drank up the whole 1.5 liter bottle within less than an hour because it felt like it was satisfying a need inside me.  If I had to choose, I would probably still pick some Pente water over the Essentia water, because the oxygen still alkalizes and has other benefits from the oxygen itself.  But Essentia would be my second choice.  If I was stocking up, however, I would get both of them.  My guess is that there different approaches to alkalizing would make them complimentary.",5
"I have a 13 year old cat with chronic irritable bowel syndrome.  He recieves steroid shots once a month, but they wear off by the end of the month.  I started giving him pet rescue remedy once a day and he has had only one vomiting episode in the last two weeks and no loose stools.  I am just amazed.  I've used the human version for stress myself for years, but I never thought to use it with him.  I put it on cat treats for him and also in his water.  He loves the treats and wolfs them down, so he doesn't mind the taste at all - great product!",5
"Simply some of the best tuna that you can find in a can. Fresh is clearly always better but not always feasible due to geographic location and/or cost and Wild Planet makes a great alternative here. Great tasting tuna, low mercury, bpa free, but still packed with protein & omega 3s and all the other benefits of eating seafood. In addition, it is simply convenient to keep around for those last minute meals when you simply have nothing ready. Product highly recommended for not only great tasting and healthy tuna but also focus on sustainable and ethical operations.",5
"I can't say this de-puffs, because I don't notice a difference, but puffiness is not usually my problem.  It is however very moisturizing and smells great.  A little goes a long way and I would definitely purchase it again.  The fact it's natural is a bonus.",4
probably the best bbq sauce i have ever used... i have tried alot of sauces too... this sauce has it all... sweetness... spice... that vinegar taste... but not one flavor over powers the other... they compliment each other... great on ribs... and chicken,5
The Beaba Multiportion Freezer Tray - Pink was exactly what I expected and more. This is a great item! I love it.,5
"These chips are great, I tried the variety pack, and I think the BBQ are the best.  They have no saturated fat or trans fat.  If you are worried about your cholesterol, try these. A little expensive, but very good.  Delivered to my door for less than they cost at the stores.",4
"This stuff is mouth watering delicious! I gave a jar to my parents, and now they are hooked as well! Try it on a home grown tomato sandwich..I just wish it came in bigger jars! And it's comparable to regular mayo as far as fat/salt etc. If you're wondering about whether you should try Baconaise, let me give you a big shove, go for it!",5
I have tried many types of pancake mixes and this one does nothing for me. Even the Food Lion buttermilk pancake mix that you just add water to tastes better.,2
"We bought 6 boxes. and drink the tea every day, did see any improvement unfortunatedly.",2
Great for abrasions.  Kept a slow healing/nonhealing venus ulcer on my father's leg infection free and actually healed it.  He had it for years and all the stuff the doctor's prescribed from the specialized wound care center hadn't been able to heal it.  Lots of stuff now on the market which may not be as good.  Read carefully about Manuka Honey and the various stuff that is being sold.  Seems like many companies have jumped on it and I'm not sure all are as pure or really from New Zealand Manuka "bee farms".,5
"I was thrilled to see that Amazon had started selling frozen Gluten Free pasta.  I ordered both the Conte's shells and raviolis.  They were delivered the very next day at no extra cost, and were still frozen in their shipping container.  The ravioli cooks up quickly and is some of the best ravioli I've ever had.  The shells take a little longer in the oven, but they're worth it!  The only reason this isn't a 5 star review is because it's a little on the expensive side, but if you're weighing it against the cost of going out for a meal, it's about the same price you'd pay for regular pasta at those popular Italian chain restaurants.",4
My dogs love these treats. I have made several orders of these as they are extremly cheap for what you get. I would recommend.,4
"I've enjoyed Zhena's teas in the past and decided it was economical to begin purchasing as loose leaf.  This has not disappointed the leaves are in good shape, minimal dust and the aroma is incredible.  Would highly recommend.",5
I can not believe the quality of this paste. It is truly delicious. If you love good Indian food you will not be disappointed. Incredible for the price.,5
"This version of 5-hr Energy DOES HAVE caffeine. If you read the label carefully, it states that this decaf version has 6mg of caffeine.  I like that it has a smaller amount of caffeine compared to the original.",5
"Eye Bought This Product On A Recommendation. However, Eye Cannot Seem To Get Past The Strange Taste Yet.  Eye Will Keep Using It To See If This Will Pass Or If Eye Will Acquire A Liking To It.  The Package States No Bitter Taste.  If It Is A Sweetener, Why Should There Be Any Bitter Taste?",3
"This product does not smell very well to me.  In fact, I have to use a fork to ""tenderized"" the pieces for my old kitty cat.",3

"We have a new puppy who has to take antibiotics twice a day for kennel cough.  The puppy hates the pills and it took a lot of time and stress to get him to take them.  I did an internet search and found out about pill pockets.  I didn't buy from Amazon because I needed them right away, I paid $13 at Petco.  They are a lifesaver, we have the beef flavor and he eats it right up.  He loves them.<br /><br />Since the antibiotics will use up almost the whole bag I'm putting in an order through Amazon for more pill pockets to keep on hand.",5
"great tasting, crunchy Virginia peanuts.  next time I would get the version without the skins because my daughter doesn't like skins.",5
We tried this as per our ped recommendation for our colicky acid reflux baby who just did not sleep well at all starting at about 2 months old 2-3 oz mixed with her bottle in before bed. From day one this worked great. Just enough to help calm and sooth her and definitely helped relieve some tummy problems and gas from colic crying. She still didn't start sleeping through the night but it definitely helped as she started sleeping at least one 6 hour block at night which is a godsend when you are only getting 3-4 hours total per night.,5
Now you can have the Mercedes of the chocolate world to flavor your creations at home!  I LOVE this stuff.  I even make my own chocolate syrup with it!  You won't be sorry!,5
"This is a delicious tea, but I don't know if it did anything to reduce weight. It also contains Oolong tea which has research behind it to support a slight rise in metabolism. The taste is good enough that I don't care if it works for weight loss.",5
I received this product as a gift a long time ago.  I recently was reminded about ths product and decided to purchase some in hopes it was still good.  It did not disappoint.  Big Train is delicious!,5
"I have no negative comments about this product. It far exceeded my expectations and there is no better price either at any other site. I became interested in the Cacao nibs after reading the rave reviews and the health benefits( full of minerals and antioxidants) of the raw, organic bean at various raw food lifestyle sites. Although I am not 100% raw, I am trying to exchange as many foods as I can. These nibs are crunchy--but not rock hard crunchy. Do not look to compare this to processed, cooked chocolate that is full of sugar. These nibs are not ""candy"" but a healthy food. Dipped in a little agave syrup( a honeylike , low glycemic index, organic sweetener that is delicious) or honey, one would have a candy like snack. Since they are not a processed food full of sugar, they are more bitter than chocolate  but they are not by any means too terribly bitter to enjoy. I thought they were wonderful with a small amount of agave syrup. I will use them in cereal and smoothies next. More people will for sure enjoy these than not.",5
"First and foremost, let me make it clear that this item was received free to test and review through Amazon Vine Voice in May.  I have no idea how long ago this was packed together.  Nothing appears to be stale.<br /><br />The packaging was a plain cardboard box with a thin cardboard insert that takes up the length & width of the box, in an attempt to make it look like there's a wrapped Christmas package inside.  The whole thing was nicely protected for shipping.<br /><br />I've never had Cheese Straws before and wasn't sure what to expect.  They seem to be a cross between a thick cracker and a cookie.  These are Aged Cheddar by Sonoma Cheese.  The taste is pretty strong and be prepared for a hot feeling in your mouth afterward.  The package contains 2 servings.<br /><br />Three Pepper Water Crackers contains 4 servings that have the pepper visible on the crackers.  A thin, dry cracker that has a mild taste.<br /><br />Sonoma Jacks Parmesan Peppercorn gourmet cheese wedges have 6 individually wrapped wedges.  The main ingredients listed are Monterey Jack and Parmesan cheese.  A somewhat plastic/rubbery texture, although the taste is okay; nothing special.  A small cheese knife/spreader is included.<br /><br />Beth's Chocolate Chip Cookies are bite-sized with 2 servings.  The cookies appear to have a somewhat breaded coating on them that poured out of the package as crumbs.  The cookies themselves were intact and I liked the taste.<br /><br />Brown & Haley Cashew Roca.  These were really good and are doubly wrapped for freshness.  Too bad there are only 3 in the package.<br /><br />Nunes Farms Roasted Almonds with Sea Salt.  I generally eat plain almonds so I was happy to find that the salt is very light and added just enough to make these more interesting.  3 servings per package.<br /><br />1 sleeve of Ghirardelli Double Chocolate Hot Cocoa Mix.  I'm saving this for later.<br /><br />2 Ghirardelli Chocolate squares with Caramel filling.  It's Ghirardelli.  Enough said.<br /><br />1 Napa Valley Mustard Co Hot Sweet Mustard.  Label claims it's rich with honey; the main ingredient is sugar but honey is listed in there as well.  I really don't understand why this was included in the box.  There isn't anything to try it out on so this hasn't been tasted yet.<br /><br />As of this writing the price appears to be $39.99.  I just can't see myself purchasing this as a gift at that price.",3
Ok so you know the pack is smaller... but dont get too dissapointed it is a strong cup of coffee  will make you go for a while befor you will want anther 1 i am a fan.,5
"We bought this with the hope of preventing cats from getting out.  They are smart enough to bait the dog to come near the door and let them out or in as they wish.<br /><br />I think this door is overpriced.  It does not come with a battery or charger, and you really need 2 batteries so you can charge one while using the other.  We installed it into a door, so using the ac power cord is not a good option.  Also, our puppy chewed through the wire connecting our computer to the Internet the first week we got him, making us nervous about a power cord in his space.<br /><br />We got a 2nd puppy.  A few days later we found the cover of his collar transmitter in the yard.  I guess the two dogs played too roughly and the transmitter came apart?  The button battery from the inside was missing, and it was 5:30 pm.  We looked in the grass for it til it got dark but never found it.  Swallowing a button battery is a medical emergency, kind of like appendicitis, only it can affect any part of the GI tract.  So we had to take both dogs to the emergency vet to get x-rayed to see if either had eaten the battery.  No battery in either dog, thank goodness, but we spent a bit more than $250 for that information.  The collar transmitter should have a screw or something to hold it together better.<br /><br />I am currently writing this from my bedroom, and I hear the door opening and closing over and over.  A dog must be sitting too close.  Guess that means we will be charging the battery again in the am.  I'm annoyed by the sound, though it is not horribly loud.  I really wish we had gone with a heavy duty magnetic type door.",1
"I love the Plum Organics line as a whole, and the prunes are no exception.  While we make most of our own food for our daughter, it's of course more convenient to have prepackaged options.  I am very  happy that this is exactly what it says: just prunes.  The packaging is great: super portable, doesn't take up a lot of room, and it creates less waste than other types.  My daughter loves the food itself, and I like that I would use it as soon as she started solids (it's very smooth & liquidy) and keep on going with it (I now just mix it with her cereal to thicken it up).  The prices on Amazon are good, too.  It's the only line of store-bought baby food we'll use, and I recommend it w/o reservation... even to those who would prefer not to use pre-packed foods.",5
"After spending 7 years in South Texas, you learn quickly what the good stuff is among the locals...and THIS is one of them! Years have passed and after moving to Tennessee, I was disappointed when I ran out of my well-stocked supply. I ended up back in South Texas a few years ago due to a funeral so I restocked, gladly! I recently, again, ran out and was thrilled to find the product on line! I've tried many brands throughout the years and NOTHING compares....TRUST ME! They also have a NO-Salt version...a Mesquite flavored fajita mix, and a Chicken Fajita version (I've tried it on the chicken, it's good but I still prefer the regular for chicken as well...just my preference). My mom, who moved from Texas 22 years ago, also keeps her kitchen stocked with this brand. There is just no comparison. Their website, to my great surprise, offers a ton of other products that are authentic and accessible....even some recipes. I'm known for my cooking and the love thereof... :) so, I quickly, and eagerly built a cart full of their other products to experiment with. Try this product, you WON'T be disappointed!",5
"I first bought this granola in Whole Foods and it was very good, I went back and tried other varieties, it has the right amount of ingredients, so try more than one variety.",4
"My adventure with coffee started years ago; I've been through a Jura-Capresso S9 (Super-automatic) and eventually found my way to a Rancillio Silvia V3 espresso machine.<br /><br />My hunt for good beans (Tucson, AZ) has been as variable, eventually being able to find decent fresh-ish beans at the local Whole Foods-type-place (Sunflower). Of all the mail-order, vacuum-sealed, ""older"" beans I've tried (including any main-stream beans like Milestone) from a super market, these Illy are much better, but compared to real, fresh beans, they don't quite stand up.<br /><br />Taste-wise these beans are much smoother than I expected; because they are vacuum-sealed and typically 2-4months old by the time you get them, I expected the dry/sharp/bitter taste that I get from every other bean I've tried (you ever tried Starbucks beans? Good lord, bitter) and was surprised when they actually ended up being quite a bit smoother.<br /><br />The smell during grinding is a typical ""dry/old"" bean smell, it doesn't have that lustrous smell that a fresh bean does and when pulling the shot it doesn't have that carmel-colored, never-ending crema that a fresh bean gives, but surprisingly enough, it tastes pretty nice.<br /><br />At my Whole Foods-esque store, I can get fresh-ish beans for $7.99/lb, at roughly $36/lb it is *impossible* for me to justify these Illy beans.<br /><br />If you are in a location where fresh-beans are an impossibility and you have been relegated to super-market, main-stream garbage beans, and you don't mind paying the premium, these beans are quite nice and should keep you pretty happy.<br /><br />If you are a bean-snob and demand perfect behavior of your beans through the grind/shot sequence, then you probably need to keep looking and need to move somewhere where fresh coffee is more readily found :)",3
"Marley Coffee's Exotic Floral and Berry ""One Love"" organic medium Ethiopia Yirgacheffe is a great organic coffee with a rich, bold taste. I haven't tried anything remotely like it; it is definitely addictive. I tend to drink coffee that's heavily diluted with water and have found that the one serving coffee brewing bag can yield two full cups of coffee. However, please note that this is my particular take on drinking it; others may wish instead, a much stronger brew.",5
"This is the typical tobiko you have at any Sushi restaurant. It was fresh and delicious. I used it on homemade sushi, eggs and salads. I loved it!",5
"Tried matcha green tea powder for the first time and this one is actually not too bad.  It doesn't taste muddy and I taste the matcha green tea flavor.  So far, I've only tried this with hot water and as an ice tea. I will try it in smoothies next week.  Satisfied with the product and price but the only drawback is the packaging.  I cut a slit on the side and fold it after using, but a lot of the powder came out! So I had to pour it all in a tuber ware. You gotta change the packaging to a zip lock bag or something.  I wanted to order more but in the 16 oz, but the only thing stopping me is that there is a shipping fee AND it's sold by another company, why is that??",3
"For me, when the days get colder nothing is as rewarding as a simple cup of hot tea. And for it's claimed immunity benefits, a basic green tea is a common pick for maintaining a healthy natural balance during the flu season. From previous experiences in tasting the Tazo brand, both of the bottled and boxed products, they have proven to be unsurpassed for quality and flavor. Once I've tried their teas they immediately became my drink of choice. <p>The Zen Green Tea Blend is a wonderful one that has only a few ingredients with no artificial anything. And thankfully, doesn't boast the addition of fortified vitamins in some senseless amount. It truly is an enlightening blend of green tea, spearmint, lemongrass and lemon verbena. Thus making it versatile refreshment for anytime of the day, whether it's right after meals or between meals, or just before bedtime. Generally light and mild tasting, but that will depend upon how long you steep it and if you add a sweetener of some form.<p>Interesting too, are the amusing comments and remarks that appear on the packaging. Reading through this as you drink your tea makes it a distinctive experience. I never seen tea so clever! I wonder if consuming Tazo really does improve a person's outlook on life and affect his or her well being? I think it just could be the great taste and aroma and probably the reassuring thought of doing your health a favor.<br />Try a couple of their teas - they are sure to please!<br />And Tazo Zen Green Tea makes a good choice.",5
"I normally don't write reviews, but we were SO happy with this product and service!  After reading some of the other reviews, I was nervous about what we were going to receive.  However, we were VERY happy with the size and quantity of the oysters and they were extremely delicious!!!  We received 85 oysters and I think only one was ""iffy"" on whether it was dead or not.  Living in the midwest, we don't have a lot of options for ""fresh"" oysters, so the price and quick service were perfect for us!!!  Even the cleaning and shucking was kind of fun since it's not something we get to do very often!  We will definitely be ordering again!!!  My only advice is that the company does not ship over the weekend, so I ordered on a Friday night and did not receive until the following Wednesday.  Not a big deal, but not something that I realized until after I ordered!",5
Just how I like it! I can make a large cup of this on my Keurig (the one with three cup sizes) without losing any flavor. No nasty aftertastes and not bitter. Will order more.,5
My dog loves these treats more than anything else. They are a nice change from the dry biscuit or meat flavored treats. This shipped in a timely manner. The lid has to twist all the way off in order to get treats out.,5
"I loved these cookies so much I ordered two more flavors, the peach and the lemon.  They're excellent with tea in the evening.  I know some have complained about broken cookies but mine came just fine. I imagine they weren't packed right.  Mine had plenty of bubble wrap to insure they came unbroken. As I said before, I liked them so much I ordered two more flavors.",5
This is the best white tea I have ever had. Tried other Lipton flavors but this one has them all beat..Teenagers love it too.,5
I love cooking this in between meals and they are delicious. They are just a little bit too hot for me. Overall I recommend this product.,4
"I love Nutiva Hempseed!!  Not only are they a delicious whole food, chock full of raw nutrients, but these little seeds are so versatile - you can use them in so many dishes.  Sprinkle them on fruit and vegetable salads or soups, use them in smoothies, create a creamy dressing with them by blending with water and your favorite herbs and spices or just simple blend with water and strain for nut/seed milk.",5
the product comes in nicely packaged box . the appearance is very unappetizing . does not look nice . the taste is o k . it looks like " KHICHADI ".the appearance would be improved if whole basmati rice was used .will not buy again .,1
"Love it!  I am an avid tea drinker (instead of coffee), and I love this flavor.  I bought one in a metal tin for myself and savor each tea bag.  The smell of cinnamon, allspice (and maybe cardamom?) are so cozy and flavorful.<br /><br />I decided to send this as a gift to warm up someone else's spirits.  It's particularly great for autumn/winter, but I enjoy it year-round.",5
"I use chicken stock/base for a multitude of things...soups, rice, etc...and I bought this mainly because of the price I got it at. I hate boullion cubes, so I always look for the ""base"" mix...and this one is just as good as the others I've bought at the market. Great flavor, great price, what more could you ask for!?!",5
Green Mountain now colors the box light green but this product is caffeinated. Wife got Snookered caused she thought Medium roast didn't have caffeine; just cause the box was light green. Don't you get fooled too.  Coffee had a bitter taste had to put MORE French Vanilla creamer in it to make it have a smoother taste. ( that was medium roast)  Going back to Newmans Medium roast Decafe..by Kuerig.,2
"I got this maple syrup for my family after finding out the store purchased syrup is loaded with the high fructose corn syrup, which is loaded with mercury and other pesticides, organic is what we needed, now I can drown my pancakes and waffles with butter and Coombs Family Farms 100% Pure Organic Maple Syrup, delicious, great product.",5
"First things first. Snapea Crisps do have 8 grams of fat (and 150 calories) per serving, with a serving size being one oz., which is approx. 22 of the cute little life-sized pea pod thingies. The good news is that they also have 5 grams of protein per serving, so you can hold you chin up while scarfing down the bag, which has been the compulsion of everyone I've known who's tried them. Kids love the taste, too! These also make great finger food snacks for toddlers, as the little pod thingies are finely textured. My only complaint is that I have to share them with every one else in the house. At this price, tho, you can afford to buy a case and hoard a few bags for yourself.",5
Everything flavored Pretzel Crisps from Snack Factory is the most flavorful and enjoyable snack I have ever come across. Sorry to see they are not available on Amazon or maybe temporarily out of stock (I pray)! They are thin and crispy and loaded with the flavor of an everything bagel. Can't wait. They are very hard to come by in stores.,5
This pump seems to work well. My only problem is that it loses prime and must be pumped a couple of times to get the syrup into the nozzel. Not a big deal though. It sure makes metering the syrup easier than pouring it out of the bottle.,4
Its so nice to be able to order this tea online. I was sorely disappointed when my local walmart quit carryingit. so yay for finding it again!,5
"I absolutely love this coffee.  I don't like the taste of just plain coffee.  I  have to have mine with something sweet and vanilla is my favorite.  This coffee has the ease of instant and the taste of a cup of something freshly brewed.  I usually have this coffee mid afternoon as a little treat to myself after I've been running errands all day and before I begin making dinner and whatever else is happening that night with the family.<br /><br />I used to buy this coffee at the grocery store and now Amazon is the only place I can find it.  I order two cases at a time.  When I get low, I restock so I never run out.  Plus, with this quantity, I don't have to pay for shipping.",5
"Bellagio Sipping Chocolate is great, especially on long, dark winter nights.  And buying from Amazon was easier than going direct!",5
"A refreshing cold beverage and a soothing, perfect, hot cup of tea. Offers healthful benefits.",5
"When having some Asian cuisine one day, I noticed this fiery concoction sitting on the table. I put some on my plate and started eating it with an with egg roll. I was instantly hooked :-)...<br />This is a very tasty Asian-style hot sauce. It has the consistency of ketchup, but packs some nice heat. It is not like a vinegar based Louisiana style sauce, nor is it like a Mexican style sauce (typically more smoky flavored). It has a unique flavor profile, and it's great! It's sweeter tasting, with a very pronounced chili pepper flavor and just a hint of garlic, that really compliments a variety of foods. I use it on eggs, sandwiches, Asian foods, chicken, salsas, pizza, etc... Also, for the size bottle you get, it's a good value. I bought a big 17oz bottle of it for less than $3.50 at my local Walmart. Recommended!",5

"I have been reading up on Cinnamon, it appears, some are not real cinnamon but indead ""Cassia"". Cassia can be hard on the liver so, I am posting this link to a site and you can all read up on it your self and decide what to do.  I would love to hear more on this subject.  I am ""NOT"" saying to buy from this company but it has good reading and would come more good reading on the subject.  www.ceylon-cinnamon.com<br />I was made to put a rating on this product, I did buy and good price but now need to check out to make sure it is ""REAL and not ""CASSIA"".  All welcome if know about it already...",2
"Great product but made in China. Once I realized this after purchase, I got a little worried. Kind of over priced in the regular retail market. My dogs like it & have been ok but I wish I knew ahead of time where it was made.",3
"I love these Splenda flavors for coffee.........I especially like the mocha and use it regularly in my coffee.  It's not always easy to find in my small town, and so easy to order online for home delivery.",5
This all in one pack of popcorn is great! Cut the end and dump it into your popcorn maker. I use the stove top maker to make mine. Though you really need a HUGE container (6 quart) to make it properly. While the popcorn is still popping I have to empty out the contents into a bowl because it makes a ton. The popcorn is very salty. I usually hold back a little of the salt to get the perfect taste. I really like this popcorn. Just like popcorn at the movies.,4
"I tend to like very chewy jerky.  I'm looking for a lowfat, high-protein snack but if I'm going to add something like jerky to my diet I can't have all the usual chemicals and such.  So, this product is an excellent price and as far as I'm concerned it tastes great, but it's a softer jerky, almost exactly like Pemmican.  Part of the fun with jerky, and why it's such a good snack, as far as I'm concerned, is that it takes awhile to eat it.  THis is easier to eat, but that's not a huge deal, really.<br /><br />Overall, I'm very satisfied with this product.  The ""consume within 3 days of opening"" seems a little odd to me, considering it's a 1 lb. bag.  I keep it in the fridge and it's lasted several weeks without an issue.  Tastes great without all the bad stuff and it doesn't cost an arm & a leg, which is what I was looking for.",5
"When we came across this product, we were looking for a quick and easy way for my teenage runner to get her protein while on the go.  She had told us she was feeling tired but didnt' understand why as she was eating her carbs.  When we sat down and looked at her diet, there was little to no protein.  These protein bars do the trick.  She can put them in her purse or backpack and off she goes.  They don't take long to eat and taste good.  My son also takes them with him if he is going to have after school practice.",5
"My beagle eats pretty much any organic matter that crosses her path but she won't eat these at all. Also, they don't look like the one's on the box do, with a dark center and lighter outside, they are just brown dryish lumps. I thought maybe I had gotten a bad box so I tried another box but they were the same. Maybe a bad case?",2
"I'm a big hot sauce fan and this one failed me on two levels.  I like bacon, and I can't say that it tastes like bacon to me.  I do get the strong smoke flavor though -- which is not all bad as it will lend a smokey accent to any food if you like that kind of thing. I don't.  The heat level of this sauce is pretty mild. My favorite everyday hot sauce is Belizian Heat, and compared to that, this is ketchup. I'm tempted to say this seems milder than Tobasco, but I may be overwhelmed by the smokiness of the sauce and can't gauge the heat very well. This would be perfect for someone that can't handle really hot sauces but would like to add a bit of kick and a smokey flavor to foods. For those people, a couple of drops (5 - 10) in a bowl of chili will do you good!",3
Bought one at the local grocery.  Bought a case from Amazon.  Reordering now.  Yummeeee,5
"I think xylitol is great.  But... I gave my daughter a little in solution in the concentration tested and said to be tolerable for toddlers in a New England Journal of Medicine article.  Still, my daughter began vomiting everywhere almost immediately.  She never normally vomits.  I think the intense sweetness triggered a kind of protective response in her body.  Perhaps she thought it was poison.  Anyway, don't be dumb like me and try it on your toddler.  Reserve this product for older children and adults.",5
"I'm not a fan. If you like dense and dry, like a pack of desicated Fig Newtons compressed into a single bar, then Larabars may be for you, but they're not for me.",2
"I actually got this package as a ""Black Friday"" deal on Amazon, so my price was even lower than the one posted here. I couldn't believe that they had it on the sugar-free variety pack! So 6 bottles for less than 2 bottles, with my Amazon Prime ... was a deal I couldn't resist.<br /><br />My favorites are the Raspberry, Vanilla, and Chocolate, although I also enjoy the other three flavors.<br /><br />If you aren't familiar with the Torani syrups, they are an excellent addition to your coffee, your frappes, your oatmeal, your hot chocolate:  almost anything you sweeten, you can add a little Torani flavor. And unlike the creamy texture of other liquid chocolates, these are ""clear.""  In fact, if you ask for a squirt of flavor at your local coffee shop, most likely you will receive it from one of the Torani bottles!<br /><br />This summer I bought the <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002FWMF8G"">Mr. Coffee BVMC-FM1 20-Ounce Frappe Maker</a> and started making Ice Blended coffee at home. While I love using the flavored coffees, it is difficult to find my favorites locally in a decaf blend. It is also impossible to find most of the Torani sugar-free flavors locally, which I need as a diabetic. So throw some of this in with my regular decaf, and WOW!!! I'm in love.<br /><br />Note - The one kind available in my local grocery store is a 12-oz bottle for $5, comparing to  than $10 for each of these bottles. Do be cautious if you are buying the single bottles on Amazon - which run much higher than that. However, this variety pack works out to a fantastic price.<br /><br />Great Taste - Great Price - Great Product. My husband only wishes that the cherry flavor came in this deal, but hey, that means I get to use all of them.",5
"This box has a nice variety of kcups inside.  It's a great option to get you STARTED in figuring out which flavors you like.  From there, graduate to the variety boxes by the individual companies and then you should have a great grasps on what to buy in the future.",4
coffee is great deal but the expiration date on the coffee was less than 6 months !!!!,3
I love the Barefoot Contessa. I have 2 of her cookbooks and love the show. I have made this coffee cake the long way and from this box. Both are fantastic. Everyone loves it. It's a nice treat on the weekends or to serve with your afternoon tea or coffee.,5
"I don't really eat these on a regular basis. These are my breakfasts when I sleep in late or my lunches when I can't be bothered. I carry one with me in my bookbag/purse just in case. They taste good and keep me from being hungry for hours afterward. One of the few bars that I've seen with a decent amount of fiber and protein. My husband likes them too. I can easily see these being a good daily breakfast if you're busy or trying to diet, or as an addition to a meal if you're trying to gain.",5
"Hickory is one of the top flavors when we asked US troops what they like.  They love the steak strips as they are a bit softer but very satisfying.  If being able to carry along a snack, and needing protein is part of your decision, this flavor in a steak strip cannot be beat !  You won't go wrong on this item.",5
"This tastes quite gross. Even at half serving and masked with other strong flavors in a shake, it is nearly inedible.",2
I did not notice any off-taste in my coffee where I use Splenda the most.  And to think of getting 1 gram of fiber per teaspoon is remarkable!  I haven't tried it for anything but sweetening coffee and lemonade.  So far so GOOD.,5
"As a long-time owner of a pair of espresso stands in the PNW, coffee is an important part of my life.<br /><br />Cafe Bustelo Mexican Blend is, hands-down, the best instant coffee in today's marketplace.<br /><br />Coffee snobs need not turn up their noses;  if an instant is what you require, buy this and enjoy your cuppa!",5
Ayahuasca Vine alone will not give any pleasant or interesting trip. But combined with mushrooms or DMT it will give an intense trip. This special combination is capable of inducing a powerful psychedelic experience because the MAO inhibitor present in the Ayahuasca preserves the DMT. DMT is a psychoactive chemical which produces intense visuals and strong psychedelic effects but is usually rendered ineffective when taken orally because it is easily broken down by the body's MAO enzyme.,5
"What can I say! I like Macadamia Nuts.  These are good.<br />Ordered on Wednesday and they were here Friday.<br />When these are gone, I will buying some more.",5
"I purchased these after hearing of the many health benefits of raw cacao. This is the only brand I have tried and have been completely satisfied with them. I use them mostly in my smoothies,they're specially good in my green smoothies. Good product and a good deal.",5
"Excellent product, also have a great peanut flavored bar. Not too dry, perfect start to the day. I've tried 'em all; this is my fav'.",5
"I thought we were getting the enormous bundle for the price I paid, which I thought was a deal. Instead it turned out to be a small pack of the twists. Could have gotten these in person for the same amount elsewhere.",3
"Perfect flavor on the medium size setting.  I used to have to do two of the Kenya AA extra bolds on the small setting to even get close to the flavor of this cup.  So, this actually saves me money too...very nice:)",5
"When I read the other review of this tea, I had to write.  This tea has a wonderful, balanced flavor that mixes the tartness of raspberry and the sweetness of peach to come up with a smooth blend.  I usually want a little honey in my tea, but this one doesn't really need it.  Makes a great iced tea, too!",5
"I purchased these crackers because I have a wheat allergy and they are delicious.  They are not like other rice crackers I had tried.  Now everyone in my family prefers them over regular saltines, and I even have to order them for my mother in law!!!  They are crispy, tasty with just the right amount of salt, and very satisfying.  I highly recommend them.  Amazon is the best place to buy them for price and availability.",5
"Received package today, which is very quick shipping.  Disappointed in the sampler pack.  Out of 24 k-cups, 7 are Caramel Vanilla Cream, and 5 are French Vanilla, which makes half of the box vanilla.  (Good thing I like vanilla, hope I like these) Being shipped in a brown paper bag in the box really doesn't bother me, I just wish there were more samples in the Sampler.  I probably will not order again.",3
I purchased the 29 oz size and it has a great taste and is good for cooking. It has really lasted us a long time and I love that you can use it for everything!,5
I've always liked Twinings Tea.  I drink Earl Grey in the winter but wanted something lighter in the summer.  This worked perfectly.,5
"I normally buy Earth's Best Soy Formula for my baby since she is somewhat sensitive to lactose, but I purchased the milk-based formula because Amazon sold it in the 20% More 4-pack.  I have not noticed any difference in my child since switching, and she couldn't seem to tell the difference either.  I use formula as a supplement to breast-feeding, so she only gets 1-2 bottles a day.  I'm willing to spend the extra money to buy organic formula from a company I can actually trust, especially when I can buy it in bulk, and she already drinks so little of it.",5
If you enjoy different foods-regular salt in a regular shaker-this isn't for you! If you like to spice things ud differently- it may be.,3
"these are sooooo good!! If I didn't have self control, I would have finished the entire 2 lb bag in one day.",5
I got this for authentic mai tais and it's perfect. Use the original Trader Vic's recipe for authenticity. Viscous syrup with beautiful floral almond flavor. I actually caught my husband drinking it straight. Shipping is pricey so be prepared.,5
"I've ordered both the Soft Winter White and Hard Red wheat from Great River and have been pleased with both!  I use these in my grain mill for baking flour.  The taste and texture is perfect!  Also, you can't beat the price per ounce, even better than our local bulk foods store!",5
"I have a golden retriever as well as a pembroke welsh corgi. They love their food and tend to inhale it. But they are also very smart and tend to get board. I bought the Star Spinner as well as the paw print shaped toy by this same company and they had a blast from the moment I filled it and set it on the floor! I love that the toys are plastic. So they are much easier to clean (just spray and rinse in the sink, or wipe out with a clorox wipe). Particularly since my corgi prefers soft/moist treats as compared to my dry kibble loving golden. I bought this for roughly $20 at my local canine specialty store, which is far more affordable than the ""name brand"" products. And since I worry about the bacterial growth on the far more expensive wooden models, the easy to clean and disinfect plastic one has been perfect for us. Safety Note: as with ANY dog toy, please supervise your dog while using. Their ""drive"" will be increased while playing with the toy, and with the paw print model with the removable cups, don't let your dog chew on the cups, but redirect him to the treat inside the dish after he pulls out the cup. My golden retriever loves it so much that I now use it to give him his kibble every day! Which is much safer as the bigger dogs tend towards bloat, which can kill your dog. This allows him to have fun while eating tiny amounts of kibble at a time. Win,Win!",4
"I have tried a number of k cup hot chocolates and grove square is by far the best yet!  Very nice flavor, doesnt have the nasty artificial sweetener flavor like a lot of the kcup hot chocolates.  very impressed!",5
"I usually take one of these before lifting weights or going out to the club. I'm often tired from work so this gives me a good amount of energy to push through an activity. The best part is, I never crash from it. I would take one of these over a traditional energy drink any day.",4
"I picked this up at my supermarket thinking the kids and I were in for a real treat; they'd had peppermint hot cocoa from a restaurant recently and were begging for more.<br /><br />You mix this stuff with one cup of hot milk and have to stir like mad for a long time to get it mixed in properly. No matter, it still tastes like sharp, unpleasantly watery dark chocolate and not the creamy rich cocoa we were hoping for. A nasty brew -- the kids hated it instantly and so did I. Other than this stuff I am a dark chocolate fan, but come on..! Starbucks has some nerve calling this stuff ""velvety"".<br /><br />A waste of money. Now I have to find some unsuspecting sap to pass this on to. And yes, I just ended that sentence with a preposition! RAWR!!",2
"I normally love this product - 5 stars - but in this shipment the bars were all hard like a rock. I wonder if it had been stored improperly prior to shipment. Still tasted great, but not the soft like the KIND bars I buy in the store.",3
These tomatoes are unlike any tomatoes I have ever tried.  San Marzano tomatoes are known for low acidity and high sweetness due to being grown ONLY in the fertile volcanic soil at the base of Mt. Vesuvius.  These tomatoes make the BEST sauce and these are a great price and amazing flavor.  They must be tasted to be believed!,5
"This Twinings Chai Tea Latte is soooo delicious.  This tea is to be used with a Tassimo single-serve coffee maker.  Included in the package are milk t-discs, and chai tea t-discs.  Use one of each to make a cup of Chai Tea Latte.  Deliciously spicy: cloves and cinnamon and ginger and cardamom, with a bit of sucralose for sweetness.  The milk t-disc contains a bit of sugar as well.  Very good!",5
I can't believe I could get this much great popcorn (along with the oil and seasoning) for such a low cost!  It tastes almost like movie theatre popcorn and doesn't have all the calories!,5
"My cat loves it very much.  After she finished her bowel, she would like to sit there and asked me to fill it up for her.",5
I first tried this on a trip to Mass in 1999. I can't get enought of it. I use to be able to find it in WA state but haven't for sometime now. Brought 3 jars back with me from my recent trip to VA and only have one left and have only been back a month. I love the fluffernutters they are so good. I really like them with chunky honey roasted peanut butter. My 4 year old still wants his with jelly. They are so good any way you can get them. I just wish I could find someone to sell Fluff by the case.,5
"What a heavenly fragrance towake up to in the morning!  Two of my favorite flavors - rich, dark chocolate overlaid with just the right amount of raspberry.  I used to get this from Gevalia, but they got too expensive.  Coffee Masters is cheaper and has a better product.  I will definitely order this again.",5
"This product is OK, I think it has too much sugar and the flavor is not that strong.<br />I enjoyed it, but did not meet my expectations.",5
"I absolutely love these! Seven of these sweet, very thin Graham Crisps are only 60 calories, but it's easy to eat a lot of them and there are almost 80 in the package. Delicious by themselves; wonderful with ice cream. If they are purchased using Amazon's Add-on Program there is no shipping charge.<br /><br />UPDATE:  I've seen mixed reviews of this company's products. The items I've purchased have not been stale or strange smelling.",5
"My dog loves these things! I have tried similar products by other companies and he won't touch them, but these he gobbles up as soon as we put them down. He is a picky eater so if they pass his test, they must be great!",5
We just love Nonni's Biscotti products -- especially the limone!  It's always refreshing -- not too sweet/not too tart.  Finding them on Amazon was exciting because we haven't found them locally since coming to Florida.  The product offered by Amazon was also a great bargain!,5
Chips Ahoy cookies were not very tasty.  My children and husband would not eat them.  I tried to give them away and everyone refused.,2
"One thing I have found with premade coffee or latte drinks is the overload on the sweetener. Why? It kills it. Not the case here. Excellent flavor, great over ice. A+++",5
"You have to sample them all to find the ones you like.  You'll miss out if you judge them all after tasting one or two.  My favorites are Diet Orange, Diet Raspberry/Cranberry, and Diet Energy. Diet Dr. Pete and Diet Root Beer aren't bad either.  They mix well with alcoholic beverages as well.<br /><br />HOWEVER<br /><br />I encourage everyone to visit the SodaStream webstore BEFORE purchasing any of products here. There are many flavors at the SodaStream webstore not offered here like DIET Energy and DIET Orange.  Also, as of 2/15/2012, they charge 40-50% less at the SodaStream webstore but you may have to pay for shipping.  However, if you buy 10 bottles at Sodastream, you'll get 1 bottle free.  I'm not slamming the Amazon merchants but I think consumers should be aware of the significant price mark-up.<br /><br />(With this exception, I've found Amazon prices to be competitive with other stores so I continue to be an Amazon Prime Member.)<br /><br />If you only want one bottle, it may make sense to pay twice as much with free Amazon Prime shipping.",4
I didn't find postum until 2006 and I was lucky to get a case lot of it in the end of 2007. Its all gone now. It was perfect to have in the mornings. Other then its name I don't see why it was discontinued.,5
"This is a very refreshing, slightly tart carbonated drink. It tastes exactly as one would expect. Albeit a bit pricey, the quality of ingredients makes up for it. Whenever I get a craving for a soda pop type drink this definitely takes care of that craving. I plan to order the Black Cherry flavor next.",5
I was very happy with the speed of the delivery and the quality of the treats.  My dogs love them.,5
"This is a great improvement to Trident. The flavor is bold and tastes great. I chew gum a lot of the time. I can honestly say this has a long lasting flavor. If you breathe in you can still feel it working. I think it is a pick me up if you are feeling bored at work or in school, Great gum",5
"Okay - if you haven't yet clicked to find out what the ""Vine Voice"" program is I want to add this disclaimer. Amazon has used a ouija board and crystal ball to choose a handful of amateur reviewers who they consider helpful to the whole Amazon process. I don't know how many of us there are - I'd guess less than a couple thousand. Anyway - once a month Amazon sends us an email with a list of items we can try out in exchange for a review. 80% of the list are books and DVDs you probably never heard of. Every now and then some novel item shows up.<br /><br />Anyway, this month these dog treats appeared, and it appears that a large number of vine reviewers chose them. We have a Shi-tzu Maltese mix (yes, he is as cute as you'd think that combination makes.) We treat him for good behavior. (Mainly pooping and peeing outside.) We mixed these little babies in with the other flavors,and he likes them just fine. (Another disclaimer - this is the same animal that trolls kitty litter boxes looking for ""treats"".) So - the Bit-O-Luv beef treats are just fine at our house, and now they have a legion of adoring reviews from Amazon vine voice reviewers, which seems a little like getting Sam Seaborn to write a birthday card, if you know what I mean.",4
Some of the best rice milk on the market. It's just too bad this is double the price you'll pay for it in the store.,1
My baby just  loves this one. The other brands just didnt work for us. I also conducted some research and this one seem more safer than others. Whould definitely recommend. My child has been using this one for 6 months now and for the next 3 months as well :),5
"IT is hard to get this clean.  You can soak it, but then it's hard to get it dry.  Since it is plastic, I don't want to put it in the oven.  Also my dogs (Blue heeler mix, Miniature poodle/cocker mix) don't enjoy it was much as the Kong toy.  I think that's because the Kong's movements are wobbly and more erratic--more like prey.  This cube just clunks over and they lose interest.",2
"I ordered this candy for Halloween, and it arrived promptly with no breakages or damage whatsoever.  The Wonka series candy is a favorite around our household, and this year was no exception!  I like the larger bags as well - more to share with all the trick-or-treaters.",5
It doesn't have to be "hot" to be spicy.  The Italian herbs and spices make this my favorite of the four others that used to be my favorites.  My friends who've tried this also loved it........,5
I didn't eat any but my baby liked it. She said it was savory but sweet and it reminded her of fine dining in Tuscany. Also I like that with the jarred foods is you know when you recycle it will never become waste. I just learned this and am telling everyone - only glass recycles forever. And if you don't recycle then you and I have nothing in common and you should stop reading here. It's not even a hard thing to do anymore. Nobody else in my building recycles and it drives me crazy. You just rinse it and put it in a different bin and still put it out on trash day. Stop being lazy.,4
"First off, every cat is different -- so if you suspect your cat is a picky eater, get a little bag before you try and save out on a giant one. All cats are different and it is absurd to rate a product low simply because your cat didn't particularly care for it. Second, of course it has some smell, the primary ingredient is fish meal. Almost any quality cat food will have SOME smell. If it doesn't it's probably not fresh or most of the ingredients are grains (not great for cats) and don't smell.<br /><br />The only downside of this cat food is that it does have some grain content, if you're a cat food purist this will probably deter you from buying this brand -- but you're also likely to spend a bit more (sometimes quite a bit more) on a grain free formula. Otherwise, the product is great. The fish is ethoxiquin free (ethoxiquin is a preservative that has been linked to cancer in high dosages), the chicken is free range/organic, and the 3 of the first 5 ingredients are named meat products (with no by-product). This is a high quality food at a great price. Will your cats survive on cheaper food? Sure. On the other hand, better food will improve their quality of life and can certainly reduce some potential health problems later in their lives.",4
"We love Newman's products...but Amazon lists this as 'wheat-free'.  The package ingredients label shows 'contains: Wheat'.  Not a big deal unless you have a wheat allergy...which by the way LOTS of people do.  Just thought I'd save you the hassle since food products aren't eligible for return.  As far as taste, my husband (not a pretzel fan) tried one and gave them a 3 out of 5....  'a little bland...need more salt.'",3
"My 4 year old Silky Terrier was a bit overweight. I talked to my breeder and also my Vet, and both of them recommended this Euk Small Breed Weight Control food. I tried it and MAN it worked. He slimmed down within about a month. He loves it too. He always picked and pecked at his food. Now he wolfs it down. I recommend this if your dog is a bit ""fluffy"".",5
"Not only can't I, the celiac in the family, stop eating them; but my non-celiac husband regularly steals them before I get to them!",5
We ordered this item after a friend recommended them.  They are very tasty but salty.<br />The quality is good but the value just isn't there for my family.,3
"I should have read the label on this: It is a spread, not jam. The flavor is acceptable, but I've been looking for a good rhubarb (not rhubarb-strawberry) jam since Bonne Maman stopped making theirs several years ago. I'm not rating my disappointment, though--even as a spread I thought this was average. I've also tried Andresy's rose jan (3 stars) and fig jam (4 stars).",3
"I bought these to be given on the car ride to school as a breakfast snack for my 2 and 4 year-old. We've tried other Earth's Best cereal bars and the kids have always liked them. However, these are really bad tasting. Overpowering vanilla flavor and SUPER sweet! My 2 year-old son is a vacuum cleaner, so he seemed to like them. But my 4 year year-old daughter thought they were ""gross"". I would recommend the fruit bars instead of these (they are not that messy either).",2
My son has never denied a spoonful of this oatmeal.  He absolutely enjoys it and I love that it's organic and mixes to a great consistency.,5
"My cat has food allergies - he can't have chicken, turkey, corn, or soy, among other things. So finding cat treats he can have has been a challenge, especially when he decided he didn't like the simple dried fish or freeze-dried beef lung type of treats. However, he goes completely wild for these! Since they use rice flour & tapioca as the binder, they don't trigger his allergies. YMMV, cats are very individual in their tastes, but if you have a cat with food allergies, you may want to give these a try.",5
"THis is probably my favorite Nuun flavor of all of them and I have tried most.<br />It is the perfect balance of flavor, not too strong.",5

"Most, if not all coffee drinkers would agree that decaf coffee just doesn't taste as good as caffeinated. Great caffeinated beans (whatever ""great"" means to the drinker) are pretty easy to find. But when it comes to decaf, pickin's get VERY slim.<br /><br />Kicking Horse is the best decaf for me. It's an even, very dark (consider it a french) roast and it's oily! (The whole ""oily vs. not oily"" is a never-ending debate.) Suffice to say, I prefer dark, oily beans and it's impossible to find oily decaf from a mass-production roaster.<br /><br />Admittedly, I have not performed a side-by-side comparison with caffeinated, but straight shots are remarkable. Few people would recognize that they were drinking decaf if they were served this coffee. (espresso or press, i can't speak to the taste of this coffee after drip)<br /><br />To qualify any opinion, it's important to understand the perspective of the reviewer. I don't evaluate coffee for qualities like ""florals"" or ""dark chocolate"" or ""berries"". I like rich espresso flavor, but without so much caffeine. So I cut my coffee with a dark decaf in order to get the richness that I want, and then smooth it with a little milk/cream - no sweetener, no flavorings.<br /><br />As an added bonus, I really appreciate the 15% discount for the monthly automated Amazon subscription.",5

"Meaning that you can walk down to the store and pick this up by the lb.<br /><br />Chock Full O'Nuts is the KING! There's not even a close second, maybe JFG<br />Special but even JFG takes a big backseat to this magic stuff. Full bodied,<br />magnificent flavor, an almost sweet aftertaste, and very consistent from one<br />can to the next. If you hassle with grinding your own beans and paying for<br />exotic and expensive coffee, you may want to try this on a day when you're<br />rushed and don't have time for all that.<br /><br />I've been drinking this stuff for over 20 years, and still miss the ""Gourmet""<br />that was pulled from the market in 92'. Bring it back is all I can say, but<br />until then I'll keep drinking what I can find locally. BTW, ""smart shoppers""<br />can find this in their back yard for under $10.",5

"Although I have not tried baking with this product yet, I have gone through 2 replacement orders and found the canisters leaking both times.  I think the manufacturer has a bad packaging design for this product that is definitely not mail-friendly.  It is a shame that I cannot find this product in my local grocery store.  But I believe Saco can do something to make the canisters more durable - plastic construction instead of flimsy cardboard and a tighter seal (maybe metal) instead of paper.",1

"I have had my chihuahua since he was a puppy, and he never had much of an appetite. I tried all varieties of dry and canned dog food and he would barely sniff them. He was underweight as a result and his coat looked terrible. I was so glad to discover this dog food. It is the only thing he will eat! Since I began feeding him lamb he has gained a whole pound and his coat is thicker and longer. He also eats the Wellness dry. I really cannot say enough good things about this brand of dog food. It also works for my other chihuahua who has a huge appetite but severe food allergies.<br /><br />If nothing else has worked, give this a try! You may be surprised by how much your dog loves it.",5
"I first tried San Francisco Bay Rainforest blend, and loved it, but then decided to try their Fog Chaser, and wow, what a great taste. It's a little stronger, but yet not too strong. A great blend, and it offers a nice change in taste. Love it, and again, a great bargain.",5
"I have two Peek-a-Poo's and just say Greenies and they go crazy.  These are the reformulated Greenies are made with gelatin compared to the old ones that had harmed some dogs and were pulled from market.  These are easily digested as I started them out slow and made sure they chewed and not swallowed them, which could be harmful. I trust Amazon to sell me items that will not cause harm.  I personally thoroughly check for anything foreign which is due to the manufacturer and not Amazon.",4
"I must admit the reviews influence my buying, but I don't typically come back to post one. In this case, I have to say, though it is on the sweet side (which I solve by mixing with unsweetened juice or water), the stomach problems and acid refulx I've been suffering from for a year with medication only making things worse have subsided and after using 3 bottles over the course of a week. I finally feel good and can sleep. For me, it started working after the first drink. I hope it's the same for others.",5
"All the other GF pretzels I've tried have an ""off"" flavor. These ones don't! They have a great texture and flavor. I am the only one in my household who must eat GF, but everyone -- husband and kids included -- agrees these are good pretzels. They're crunchy, but light (not rock-hard on the teeth like some pretzels can be). Great alone for a snack, or just the right thing to combine with Rice Chex, peanuts, and seasoning for a great GF party mix!",5
Came nicely wrapped and clean. Boiled half the batch and sweetened with agave. Tasted pretty good. Wish they gave more leaves for that price.,4
"When I first wrote this review, the product description had ""Tibetan Plateau"", ""Tibet"", and ""Tibetan Goji Berries"" all over the place. I'm glad to see it has been corrected just for the sake of consumer accuracy, although the product picture still shows ""Tibetan Goji Berries"" at the top.<br /><br />I think this is a great product - my wife and I both like the taste and will continue to buy. I have purchased several different products from Navitas and have never had an issue (other than the product description on this item when I first purchased).<br /><br />Don't buy into the marketing hype of a company that says their Goji berries are from the Tibetan Plateau. First off China has control of Tibet. So Tibet = China. Second the Tibetan plateau where all these berries were supposedly grown is too cold and too dry for a berry producing plant. Search it for yourself. All Goji and Wolfberry products are ""Imported from China"".",5
"This is a review for ChanTea Green Tea and Aloe Vera Passion Fruit flavor.  This is actually the first food or beverage product offered for review by Amazon that I was actually afraid to try.  I did do it however because I made a commitment to review.<br /><br />This beverage comes in a very thin plastic hexagon shaped 11.5 fl. oz bottle.  My product arrived on the first of March and sports an expiration date of 12/25/2012.  The product is made in Taiwan but has Spanish wording on one side of the bottle.<br /><br />I will talk to you about why I was afraid to try it.  First of all because it is made in Taiwan.  I am not too keen on food products that are not USA made but am especially leary of those that are Asian.  I am not sure about their safety standards and won't even eat the packaged tuna and other fish that comes from there.  I put the bottle in the fridge for a good two hours to get it cold as I didn't want to add ice to the beverage before trying it because I wanted to get a true idea of the taste, texture, etc.<br /><br />I shook the bottle up before pouring the contents into a glass.  I noticed these little gelatinous globs as I was shaking.  I poured half of the bottle into the glass.  The mixture was somewhat thick.  Those little gelatinous globs looked really gross and I couldn't bring myself to drink the beverage with them in the glass so I strained them out.  I inspected them by hand in the strainer and not being familiar with the actual Passion Fruit (I have only had Passion Fruit flavored things in the past) I figured they must be the pulp of the Passion Fruit.  They were very fragrant (overly so) but I didn't like the way they looked or felt.  I tasted the drink and it was extremely sweet.  The consistency was very syrupy-like.  The ingredients are as follows:<br /><br />Water<br />Cane Sugar<br />Green Tea Infusion (watered down green tea)<br />Aloe Vera<br />Citric Acid<br />Natural Passion Fruit Flavor<br /><br />Now, in its defense you have to like that the ingredients don't contain HFCS (High Fructose Corn Syrup) or anything you cannot pronounce.  However, this drink left a really thick coating on my tongue.  I have have had pure Aloe Vera juice before and I really could not detect any of that flavor in this beverage.  I really couldn't tell it was green tea either except for a slight bitter aftertaste.  To me it was really just a sweet Passion Fruit syrup.  I would not call this a beverage as it is not refreshing in any way.  I would consider reducing it in a pan and then pouring it over a nice stack of pancakes.<br /><br />There are 80 calories per serving and the servings per bottle are 1.5 so total calories for the entire 11.5 ozs is 120.  I can think of better ways to spend those beverage calories.",2
"This variety has a rich smooth flavor, with very little bitterness and a deep roasted taste.",5
"Well, these were disappointing for me.  After an initial taste of the flavor,  there's just an aftertaste that kind of numbs your mouth.  And these are red COLORED anise/licorice flavored ....they taste nothing like 'red licorice'.  I bought several different types and none of them have me running out to re-order the product.  Sorry Eda ...just saying !",2
"it's nice to know that the juice is organic and not from conventionally grown apples(which has pesticides, junky fertilizers etc.). you really can't tell the difference from this and the regular apple juice, which may be a good thing for my kids. all in all i'm pleased with the purchase.",4
"Unlike the other reviewer, I find this coffee to be simply amazing. I, too, am an American and I have NOT grown up on the coffee. It was a chance finding for me when a friend and I ran out of coffee and this was the only thing available at the store near our apartment. Since that chance finding, all we have wanted to drink is this particular coffee.<br /><br />I have never tasted a coffee so smooth in my life! It really is delicious. And I feel the cardamom adds a wonderful, lingering aftertaste. You really will be hard pressed to find a smoother coffee. I have converted some non-coffee loving friends into having a cup when they come over to my place simply because this coffee tastes amazing.",5
good tasting jerky for the price. My father in law had never had it before and really enjoyed the flavor. Definitely recommend.,5
"I really care for the health of my dogs, so I'm willing to pay the price for dog food that will not contain metals or by-products.  After trying many (even more expensive,) organic brands, I'm quite satisfied with Castor & Pollux' Ultramix Adult Canine Formula; and my two miniature dachshunds like it.  The mix comes with banana chips and dried carrots, and mi dogs enjoy the veggies for the most part, except that one of the them separates the carrots from his food all the time.  Just like any kid, he doesn't like carrots!  But sometimes I add a sauce or something else to the food and voila! problem solved!  I used to buy it at Whole Foods but found it $10 less at Amazon.  So, it's a win, win for me.",5

"At the time I bought Santa Fe Refrito, the idea of ""less than can"" sized portions was new to me. I would cover 7/8 of a can with plastic wrap and a rubber band. Refrito can have a high dose of sodium so I would not over do it. Santa Fe Dry refrito can be made in any size portion, in my case directly in a microwave in a 1/2 cup food storage container. Since this purchase I have noticed the availability of similar products in the bulk foods section of Fred Meyer, with even lower sodium concentrations.",4
"I bought these pretzels for my dad, who suffers from Celiac disease and Type 1 diabetes. He has a hard time keeping any weight on due his restricted diet, and often resorts to potato chips for his sole source of carbs between meals. He absolutely loves these pretzels, and said he enjoys them more than the regular kinds. I think they taste excellent, with that very slight ""burnt"" flavor that makes pretzels so good. They also seem to have a delicious buttery aftertaste IMO. Plus, they're very satisfying and healthier than potato chips.",5
"This coffee is inoffensive, but not strong enough for my tastes.  I do use cream, and I'm sure that makes a difference.",3
"I have been using La Tourangelle Avocado Oil in 'everything' since receiving my order couple weeks or so back. I like not strong olive oil (usually like the buttery kind from late ripe olives). I tasted some of this avocado oil alone and it is a bit stronger than ""buttery"" olive oil as it does have a bit of a 'bite'. I still do like it, though. I've used it for sauteing, on toast with onion or garlic powder, salads, rubbed some in my skin and a tiny bit on my chapped lips. I may get it again as I like to have a variety in my diet plus the avocado oil is good for moisturizing my skin. My fave oil is golden flax oil by Community Living Foods, except it should not be used for frying or heating.",5
"Both of my small breed dogs love their greenies treat and I like that it is good for their dental health,,",5
"I held off ordering these for a while because I was concerned I might not like the taste. I've tried some of the organic green teas and found flavor can really vary between brands. Six boxes seems like a lot to take a chance on. I really wanted something powdered to take to work though, so I gave it chance and it worked out.  To me, this product tastes great.  I am thrilled to get something unsweetened.  I wanted these to use at the office, but find I like them so much I mix them up at home too. I just wish they were a little cheaper as they go really fast.  I went from thinking 6 boxes would be a lot, to experiencing them as hardly enouugh!<br /><br />Basically, this product has a mild taste, never bitter or oily and not gritty (but it will need to be remixed if you don't drink it down quickly).  The powder does mix well, it's really a very fine powder and does not look like leaves just mashed up or anything.  It blends completely into the water, BUT it doesn't stay mixed over a long period of time.  So, if you are letting it sit in the glass about 20min or so as you sip away, it's useful to get one of those shaker bottles to keep it mixed as you go along.  That works for me, no complaints.  I am very happy with the product.  I will order again.",4
"made the switch from another brand to this peanut better after buying this on a sale here at amazon. Overall it is very tasty on peanut butter and jelly, peanut butter bread, peanut butter on ritz, peanut butter on chocolate and whatever else we use it for. Very happy and we will be buying this again.",4

My husband started to use this broth as a hot drink when he was put on a low sodium/low fat diet and he loves it.  It makes a satisfying hot drink delivering lots of full-bodied flavor.,5
"This product may work when used as intended; I wouldn't know. There were no directions for use on the jar, and the jar came without a box. I wasn't even told whether it was a leave in or a rinse out product. After reading the ingredients and feeling the texture, I applied it (moderately) to my hair. It was as though I'd coated my hair with petroleum jelly (and, indeed, the main ingredient is ""petroleum products."") I ending up having to wash my hair a second time to try removing the product. I couldn't get it all out and will have to wash my hair a third time. Perhaps this product could be used on very dry, very coarse or very damaged hair. Perhaps it is intended for buzz cuts. But it gets a definite thumbs down from me.",2
"I have 2 boxers. 1 is 16 mos. and the other is 11 months. The older one, often gets what my husband and I call ""shrimp breath"". The younger one has lots of digestive issues.

Only problem is they are expensive, that's why they get one a week.",5
I enjoy all three of the Grove Square Cappuccino flavors as does my family. I have slowly stopped buying the regular coffee and have swapped over to this brand as I seem to have become addicted to the caramel as I can't get enough of its sweet flavor. At $7.98 a box at Walmart I can buy this and NOT have to buy those flavored creamers. I shake the cup prior to use and set the machine for 8 oz....YUM!,5
"My son has peanut allergy.  I have always made my own pancake mix for the last 4 years.  But my sister in law has egg allergy so I got a box of this to try.  WOW!  Smells great out of the box, yummy while cooking and tastes awesome!  My kids ate so much there was not enough left for me!  I will buy this again for sure.  Amazon has an amazing price.  My local market wanted $7.99 per box!  It is great to know the product is totally safe for my son to eat as well.  Our house will have this in stock all the time.  Thank you Cherrybrook!",5
"My cat barely touches this stuff, especially after the can's been open for about a day or two. This is probably because she was most likely raise on cheap food (we adopted her as an adult) but I can't be sure. Apparently healthy food is less appealing to cats...",3
"Really, you can not taste the difference between this and the regular Kraft mac and cheese. I had my husband and kids (ages 15, 11 and 9) try this and they couldn't tell the difference either. The noodles are made from cauliflower and so I was expecting it to taste a bit like cauliflower with cheese sauce. Nope. You can't tell. This would be a good and sneaky way to add more veg and fiber into yours or your kids diet.",5
"Amazon has an excellent price on all the Premium Edge dog foods. I chose this brand after reviewing it on the dog food anaylsis websites. It has excellent quality ingredients, and best thing is my dogs LOVE it!!",5
"When I was little, I coined a word for things that tasted SO good, just about nothing else could compare.  The word is: ""scrumptuutious"", (pronounced ""scrump-TOO-shus"", or ""scrump-TOO-tee-us"", if you prefer an English pronounciation....  Very, very few foods qualify for this appelation --but ""ROBINSON'S APPLE & BLACKCURRANT -- also known as ""Fruit Squash"" -- qualifies with a capital ""Q""!<br /><br />If you buy this delicious drink, my first suggestion is that you remove the labels, as much as is possible, from the tall, elegant plastic bottles. (This was not too difficult at all, at least for me, as the bottles I received had their labels very, very lightly attached to begin with.)  Then take the bottle(s), and put them in the refrigerator, and have the refrigerator's light shine through the bottle(s).  The dark-red liquid inside is so extraordinary, that you may see a beautiful, optical illusion: It may seem as if the slim, elegant bottle(s) is (or are), suddenly filled with the most equisitely beautiful and costly ruby....shaped just like the bottle(s)!  Or, if you wish, a non-alcholic beverage that looks exactly like the finest of fine red wine!  Of course, this is really just the pure, transparent concentrate inside, lit up and lit through, by your refrigerator's light....but it really is something quite wonderful, and quite beautiful, to see!<br /><br />I suggest you do this JUST after having received your bottles.  For this way, they are unopened, and you get to see the whole bottle lit up.  However, once the bottle is opened, the wonderful taste within will probably be a precursor to there not being very much left in the bottle, for very long....no matter how much you, and/or others in your household  try to restrain yourself! (selves!)<br /><br />If you like grape juice, you will absolutely LOVE this drink.  (If you don't like grape juice, it is possible you won't like FRUIT SQUASH either,,,but to be sure, give it a try anyway...) There is a slightly more sweet, slightly more acidic taste to this drink than plain grape juice has.  Black currants are, I have learnt, a separate variety of small, dried grapes. (Note too that ""currant"" is spelt with an ""A"").<br />Don't let the price scare you off....this is a CONCENTRATE!  The front label directions of this Fruit Squash -- describing milliter servings -- may be a little confusing for those used to ounces, instead of milliliters.... But on another Robinson Prouduct -- the equally scrumptuutious LEMON BARLEY WATER, (also, I must shamelessly admit, reviewed by me for Amazon.com) -- it is more clearly stated:  ONE part Robinson product, to FOUR parts water. Actually, these directions are also on the Apple and Blackcurrant fruit squash....but only on the back label, in far smaller letting.  (Note to Robinson's Sopft Drinks, Limited, and Britvic.com -- PLEASE put these far more clear,<br />""one part Robinson's to four parts water"" directions, on ALL your products, in LARGE lettering, on either front or back label.  Your American and other customers who are more familiar with ounces than they are with milliliters, will thank you!) In any event, this means that each 1 liter bottle, (slightly more than a quart), will make FIVE liters of fruit squash!  This is a bit over one gallon & a quart....and thus the concentrate serves to save LOTS of room in your refrigerator, as well as allowing one to add whatever water, (tap, Evian, distilled, etc.), one wishes!<br /><br />Robinson's Apple and Blackcurrant is good either hot or cold.  It's also good to add to recipes....either full or half-strengh...when ""grape juice"" is called for.  But please....use full or half-strength ONLY for recipes! It is tempting, I know, to try the concentrate full-strenght for drinking...and, (as I am, after all, reviewing this product for the benefit of other people), I did take the liberty to do just that, once or twice, (ok, maybe I tried it full-strenght three or four times....just to make sure, and ONLY for testing purposes, you of course understand...: )  Anyway, drinking this product full-strength led, for me anyway, to my heart beating faster than usual.  A danger sign...so I stopped doing it.  Grapes are used to make wine, after all, and though this product is non-fermented, and thus non-alcholic, a strong, concentrated dose of liquid grapes DOES have a negative effect...albeit, for me, (weighing as I do, some more than few pounds overweight), only a slight negative effect.  On the label of both Robinson Proucts which I have tested, in fact, are words of warning to be sure ""to add extra liquid, if given to toddlers, (and children)"".  It is far more economical, and far safer, to follow the directions and add the four parts water for drinking, (and perhaps also cooking), purposes.  The taste is remarkably the same to drinking the concentrate ""straight""...and if, like me, you like things extra, extra sweet, a small bit of extra sugar, (mixed with the smallest amount of boilt water, to dissolve), and or artificial sweetener, can be added.<br /><br />This is, as I have said, a non-alcholic drink.  But it is SO very tasty, so VERY satisfying, that it can be served with pride to even those trying to moderate, or eliminate their consumption of alcholic drinks -- or to those who, for religious or other reasons, have decided to foreswear alcholic drinks altogether.  Diluting it to five or six parts water to one part conentrate make it, I think, the perfect treat for children's birthday parties!<br /><br />It's kind of difficul6 to believe that only 8% of this product is from comcntrated Apple Juice, and only 2% is from concentrated Blackcurrant juice.  The front label proclaims, however, that there are ""NO Artificial<br />Colours or Flavours"" inside, and this is true.  In all, the ingredients listed are: Water.<br />  Fruit jiices from concentrate, (Apple 8%, Blackcurrant 2%)<br />  Glucose-Fructrose syrup<br />  Sugar<br />  Citric Acid<br />  Natural Colour, (Anthocyanins)<br />  Preseratives (Potassium Sorbate,<br />  Sodium Metabisulfite)<br />  Acidity Regulator, (Sodium Citrate)<br />  Sweeteners (Aspartame, Saccarine)<br />  Natural Flavouring<br /><br />  CONTAINS A SOURCE OF PHENYLALANINE.<br /><br />All in all, a pretty good label -- especially these days.  NOT entirely natural...but with ingredients found in many other soft drinks, none of which taste quite this good!<br /><br />...................................................................<br /><br />""I can't believe how good they are!""  This is how my sister, visiting my mother and I in New York from her home in Denver, described her first taste of GUYLIAN Belgian Chocolate sea-shells, (also for sale here on Amazon!)  I suppose this was her way of saying ""Scrumtuutious""!  Either way, this also describes the delectable, wonderful taste of ROBINSON'S<br />APPLE & BLACKCURRENT.  Five stars....and, (as the company has been in business sine 1823), a Hundred and Eight-Six ""Cheers!""",5
"The last 3 cases I've ordered had some dented cans located in the center of the case. I've read other coplaints about this also and wanted to warn potential buyers. The problem is not with amazon but with the manufacturer and how the cans are selected to be stocked inside the cardboard flats. I keep ordering for convenience and love Amazon. My cat loves the product and it is hard to find locally or stocked in a store far away. I sift through every case to make sure the seal hasn't been broken on any dented cans and usually throw away a few. My next case arrives in about a week. If it is dent free, I will revise my review and rating.",3

I stumbled across this coffee at the grocery and thought I'd give it a shot. Well, I am hooked. Tastes great and it is much easier to create a cup while still half sleepy.  Avid Amazon shopper, so I will get it here next time.  Did I mention that it only costs about 8 cents/cup?",5
"I agree with Lizzie.  :)<br /><br />I purchase cases of the 12.5 ounce cans for my cats at the local mom and pop pet supply store.  It is the only brand that they consistently will eat that is grain free.  I have two cats that only eat wet food and use one 12.5 ounce can per day.  It's a great bargain compared to the smaller cans.  I would purchase it online if the cost with shipping was closer to what I pay at the local store.<br /><br />If you're trying to go GRAIN FREE or at least ALL WET FOOD for your kitties, do try Wellness.  I have tried nearly every type of grain free or lower grain or organic/natural canned cat food there is available; while my cats will eat some of the other stuff sometimes, they like Wellness the best.  I only feed them the plain Turkey and Chicken flavors, since they usually don't do too well with beef or seafood.<br /><br />(Note:  by grain free I mean no corn, wheat, or soy.  If you look at the ingredient list, there are sweet potatoes and other vegetables/fruits, so it is not just protein.)<br /><br />GO GRAIN FREE!  It's better for the kitties.<br />My 12 and 13 year old cats are shinier, healthier, and more active now that they've changed to this diet over the last year.  My fat cat lost weight and no longer has flaky skin.  They only throw up hairballs now instead of the frequent ""other"" vomits before.  And the diarrhea that was plaguing one cat for the previous two years has completely ended.  Solid, regular poops - believe me, it's a relief (yes, I know it's gross to talk about, but it's true!).<br /><br />I may take the final step to RAW DIET for them... haven't decided yet.  But at least I know on this food they are thriving.",5
Yeast Extract has an Acquired taste!~ Spread a thin layer w/butter on toast. Reminds you of the after'taste of beer!~,5
I am so pleased with the soy wrappers that I ordered. I heard about them and couldn't find them anywhere...then Amazon came through. You can always count on Amazon.<br />If you are on a low gylcemic or carb diet these little wrapper wrap up a sandwich very easily. Practically no taste...but they hold everything together which is wonderful.,5
I wanted a natural flavoring for use in home-made seltzer. This powder works well and has a nice flavor. It will cause a slight haze in the seltzer. This is probably due to the hard water I use to make the seltzer. If you used distilled water I believe the water will remain clear. The haze is tolerable in my experience. The flavor is great and that is what I wanted.,5
"I've been a vegetarian for nearly 20 years and mostly not much I've missed.....but marshmallows....ahhh there is just something about them that takes you back to childhood. Okay, I was skeptical that these would taste anything like I remembered marshmallows tasting.....man was I pleasantly surprised....they really taste almost exactly like I remembered. The texture is great, they are sweet and do in fact get melty and gooey in hot chocolate or on a graham cracker w/chocolate. I was sooooo thrilled to find these and soooo glad I gave them a try...didn't think I'd ever get to have smores again, so glad I was wrong. Give them a try they are great and worth the slightly high price tag for any veg dying for a little taste of childhood!",5
I made the mistake and purchased the duck. Although my dogs coat was very shiny her breath smelled like fish after eating and after awhile I cancelled my order. The smell was too much.  I will be trying the chicken instead.,2
I have been buying this oolong for about a year and have found it to be good quality @ a great price. However the most recent bag I received is disappointing. It tastes much more like a black tea than an oolong. But given my past experience I will give it another chance.,3
"The spicy flavoring on the chips is not bad and the chips are nice and crunchy.  The chips themselves though, taste terrible.  Somewhere between plain flour and dirt with a chemical tinge.  No thanks.",1
"The flavors are good, however, the pops come off the sticks.  Fortunately I know the Heimlich maneuver because my 5 year old was choking on one that came off almost whole.",3
"We really liked this coffee - it smells great and the taste is rich, intense, smooth and delicious. Brewing instructions state that two rounded tablespoons should be used per cup which is way too much unless you want to grow hair on your chest. Another tip - some reviewers have mentioned bitterness - a pinch of kosher salt added to the coffee grounds which counteracts bitterness. After drinking this, I'm looking forward to trying the caramel flavor. However, the price of this small 11 oz. bag is way too expensive and I can find equally good coffee for half this price at my local market.",4
"To keep this short, like all K-cup cocoas I've seen available this one contains artificial sweetener (sucralose aka Splenda), presumably to offset the smaller portion vs. packets with a sweetener that's sweeter than sugar. Since I hate the taste of acesulfame potassium & sucralose I've disliked all the K-cup cocoa varieties. According to Timothy's website the standard packets of their White Hot Chocolate don't contain artificial sweeteners so that may be an option, but I'll stick with mixing cocoa powder & sugar in a cup and lose some convenience.",1
"I'm a fan of Remy Martin and Courvoisier, I received this bottle for father's day,<br />and I was really surprised how smooth and delicious it is.  I would highly recommend Cognac fans to try this bottle, you will not be disappointed.",5
"Cherries are fresh and delicious.  One reviewer thought they were too sweet so I was a little concerned they would taste too sugary, but to my taste they do not.  Bulk price & the subscribe and save feature make the cost reasonable for such quality dried fruit.<br />Fast ship, too.",5
"Smells delicious but the taste is not.  ""Best served cold!"" is printed on the back of the bottle, probably because the colder it is the less you notice how bad the taste is.  For some reason there's an aftertaste of chemicals.  The bottle is pretty nice but that's about it.",1
"I'm giving this four stars because I do ""like"" it, but I wouldn't give it any sort of enthusiastic endorsement only because it's actual cost-benefit is hard to gauge.<br /><br />From one bottle, I cannot speak to the benefit of any of the various claims about it's possible benefits - pH balance, etc.<br /><br />I can speak to the taste, and I have no problems with it. It tastes like purified, filtered water with no special after-taste. My girlfriend noticed a tingling taste on her tongue, and her theory was the added baking soda ingredient might have caused that. I did not notice that at all.<br /><br />We drink filtered water from the tap - but it's well water - and for me the Essentia was a step up in lack of any aftertaste. But I doubt I'd spend money on a package of this. Still, seemed like an acceptable bottled water option.",4
"The coffee ""Blend"" is really lean on Kona and really fat on fill. I could not get a full bodied taste no matter how I ground it. If you want real Kona taste, spend the bucks and buy real Kona!!!",2
"My new addiction:  peanut butter and coconut oil on toasted wholewheat bread.  It's yummy and healthy.  Also, coconut oil is a delicious change from olive oil in salad dressing.  Just melt it in the microwave--not too hot--and add garlic and lime juice.  Toss with lettuce and tomatoes and whatever else you like and you'll be oohing and ahhhhing.  I've also been using it on slaw.",5
"They were a little stale, but I figured as much... the bucket isn't exactly air-tight. Still love them, these are one of my favorite candies :)",4
This is great stuff.  Very thirst-quenching and healthy.  The monthly deliveries have been perfect.,5
"Given that there are gummies (Haribo) that try to stay on top of competition, Albanese Assorted Gummis Bears have by far become the best. The flavor, texture, and assortment were great! I would recommend to any gummy bear fan to try these. It won't leave you disappointed!",5
I have been gluten free for almost 3 years and Pamela's Baking mix is the best I have found.  I make my waffles with buttermilk and they are delicious!  I highly recommend it to anyone.  Buy it in the pack of 3 from Amazon for the best price since it is expensive elsewhere.  Only half a cup of mix per meal for me makes a waffle and a little left over for dog treat.  Dog loves it too!,5
"This is a delicious, thick, sweet balsamic vinegar.  I have been using it exclusively for a couple years.  I first found it in a local gourmet shop for $32 and later found it at Whole Foods for $26 and then by chance, a manager's special at Metropolitan Market for $17.99.  I was about to order it from Amazon but see there isn't that much of a price savings.  I will keep looking because I love it; it's so delicious.  Sorry, Amazon, you usually beat prices elsewhere but not on this item.  To be fair, it's probably a dollar or two cheaper.",5
"I've lived GF since the age of 12 (in other words, along time)lol.<br />These are terrific cookies.  I am usually fairly restrained when eating sweets, but I admit, I would have eaten the entire bag in one sitting had I not thought about the calories and the fact I was getting really full.<br />If you are looking to feel like you aren't deprived, then you must try these.<br />Other than the fact, that they tend to be a bit more crumbly than most cookies, they are a winner.<br />ENJOY!",5
"Not big on making food reviews because I almost feel they are waste of time considering people's taste buds can be so different but my gf and I love these Buddy Fruits. She's big on fruit snacks (worse than a 5 yr old) and she has tried probably every single type out there. Raspberry Buddy Fruits are her fav. To me they taste like real fruit not that chemical taste I get from most fruit snacks, they're not like gummy bears a bit harder which I like, and best of all they're very healthy compared to other fruit snacks at your grocery store. Don't feed your kids crap, give these a try.",5
"I really enjoyed this, and will probably be purchasing other flavors as well (if they are re-stocked - it seems that most of them are sold out).  I wanted something a little better than what I find in my area grocery stores, and this was really good.  The first time we made it, it was with milk, and it was a little too rich for me (which I thought was impressive, especially as I was only using skim milk), so I've since moved to a combination of milk and water, and it tastes GREAT (and I'll probably still make it with just milk, after adjusting more towards that over time).  My house is known for hot cocoa (we have at least 7 options right now), but everybody who has had this has enjoyed it.",5
This paprika is very fresh & the refillable tin packaging is superb and hard to find in these days of ubiquitous plastic.,5
These bars are tasty. They don't really taste like a brownie to me but are certainly chocolatey and yummy. They have a good amount of protein in them and are a good afternoon snack. If you are trying to gain muscle mass they aren't the best thing to have after a workout as they contain almost no carbs and for those of you who know about proper nutrition you will know how important it is to have carbs after a workout. All in all though a good bar and will buy again.,4
"The box was delivered swiftly and the product is great - tastes great and has a LOOOOOONNNNNGGGGG far out expiration date, too, in case you can't trust your taste buds.<br /><br />Cheaper than buying at the grocery and packaged in good portion sizes.<br /><br />We keep little bags in our car ""emergency box"" and purse, too, for kids and selves when running hungry on the road.",5
Got the vanilla beans right away. They were packed so they would stay fresh. Smelled wonderful when opened. I am using them to make our homemade vanilla. Would buy this again.,5
"I supposed as a treat, this would do better than its dog food. But I was wrong when I received and tried it today. My dog does not like it at all. This treat feels like cookies and very dry. I got a small dog (Yorkshire). I don't know if big dog will find it delicious or not. Just my own experience.",2
"These have much more flavor and taste than regular tortilla chips.  Always a hit when friends come over and we put out the snacks. Top quality ingredients; brown rice, oat fiber, sunflower seeds etc. are what give this product the taste to start a conversation. Serve with fresh veggies and a good dip, always a crowd pleas-er!  I certainly would recommend this product to anyone who is trying to eat more healthy food with great flavor.",5
"I have had Blue Popcorn before, so I KNEW what I was buying (unlike previous reviews.).  The kernals are significantly smaller, but then when you make the Popcorn...you just ""ADD more"" kernals in your pan!!!<br /><br />This Popcorn has superior ""crunch"" and flavor compared to ANY popcorn I have EVER eaten.<br /><br />I do consider myself a ""Self-Proclaimed"" POPCORN ADDICT!!!!  I could live on this food only the rest of my life!!!",5
"These were a great quick snack that did not raise my blood sugar level and you could sprinkle a variety of seasons to your taste preferences.  However, I chose to use the auto ship. Because of new health issues, I am unable to eat these anymore.  However because Lowrey's does not give you any option or information on how to cancel an order, I am forced to waste money buying these and having to toss them.  I hate to write this here, but maybe if they read it, they'll add the contact information.  Thank you.",4
Love Chick O Sticks and ordered three boxes as Christmas gifts.  But unfortunately they were not packaged properly and most of the sticks were broken in two to three places.,5
THIS CANDY IS ADDICTING! I should warn you that once you eat one of these candys your soul will forever want MORE! The only problem I had with them is the shipping took 4 day longer than it should have but it was still good service. BUY BUY BUY,5
"I had been using the 'original' Chebe mix. Then from the Chebe website www.Chebe.com, I saw a recipe for sticky rolls using the Cinnamon version of this item. Wow....they got rave reviews from even the folks that didn't need to eat Gluten-free. GOOD STUFF! Easy to make. Certainly an item that will be used again and again at our house. You can use this mix to make several things, so it is a multipurpose mix. Again you can check out www.chebe.com to find ways to use it.",5
My 14 month old golden has a terrible habit of eating grass.  Her stools become very loose.  By giving her the pumpkin it firms  right up.  Beats the expensive medicine the vet gave me.  Wish it was a little less expensive.  She loves the taste...better than dog treats.,5
"This syrup is very tasty. However, it has a laxative effect on your body. Sugar alcohols, maltitol being one, leaves one gassy and in some cases with diarrhea. One morning I made pancakes for my family. My son had diarrhea, and me and my daughters had very bad gas. I said to myself, it must have been something that we ate. I narrowed it down to the syrup because we all ate it. I looked at the ingredients on it and decided to look up maltitol and it sure enough said that it is a sugar alcohol and can have a laxative effect on the body. So I never used it again. So if anyone experiences discomfort after eating this syrup then know it is the cause.",3
"So when I first smelled the dry powder I thought, oh tart, crisp, light, berry!<br />My daughter's first impression was ""Mom this smells like Red Bull energy drink.""<br />I was like OMG you are SO right!<br />It does! I have to admit. I do love Red Bull. Actually I had a bit of a Red Bull problem not too long ago, before tea! Thank you tea!<br />Nonetheless it has that exact same tart smell to it!<br />Don't worry though this is totally healthy!<br />Plus after preparing my matcha, adding some ice and milk, it tastes NOTHING like a red bull!<br />Okay maybe a little something like it in the sense that it is light, crisp, refreshing, not too tart but just a slight berry tartness but nothing that is going to make you pucker!<br />I love this!<br />I feel bad and I owe an apology to summer. Here I was craving autumn and forgot all about berries, fruits, juicy ripe tasting delights and had went totally for heavier, richer, creamier, flavors. But you know what ... it is still summer and I am going to totally enjoy drinking this and many other light matchas to come!<br />As I am sitting here in delight sipping away I am noticing this almost earthy flavor to it - no not the normal earthy grassy flavor of a matcha or green tea, but something else. The prominent flavors are still the same, tart, juicy, etc, not to be redundant, but there is something more, its one of those flavors you swish around in your mouth, tap tap tap your tongue around, make those smacking sounds trying so hard to pin point it but it is eluding me! I want someone else to get some of this so they can help me figure it out.<br />Yes this one is a delight and to think I almost passed it up I mean I was not too sure what to expect and didn't want something too overly tart but thank goodness I went for it!",5
I bought this because I like chocolate.  But this isn't very strong and I'm afraid I would have liked it with a stronger chocolate flavor.  But as a little something in coffee it does add some taste.,3
I have purchased coffee on line as I think I can get good quality and avoid the high prices of Starbucks etc... I make my own coffee now. I believe I can save over $900.00 a year by making my own coffee and not buying coffee by the cup. In these tough economic times $900.00 is a lot of money.,5
"No way does it taste like the real thing, (which would be HELLMAN'S -the best tasting) but since I'm not much of a mayo person, it works for the little things I use it in.",3
We love the coffee.  We bought the french press grind.  Very good flavor and aroma.  This company has good service and prices.,5
This makes a great cup of coffee and is not too strong. It's the perfect morning brew to get the day started.,5
"I don't need to eat gluten free products, but I like oatmeal, chocolate and coconut, so I figured I'd give them a try.<br /><br />I have to say I'm happy that people on gluten free diets have such a delicious option. It has just the right amount of everything and is a good, satisfying size. Nice chunkiness too. I did find them a tad on the dry side, so I had them with coffee in the morning and did a quick dunk to make them just right. It was a good breakfast that carried me until lunch.<br /><br />I will definitely be interested in buying them in the future, and will check out other products by this company.",4
"Coffee People Extra Bold Kcups are some of my vary favorites for using in my Keurig Brewer.<br />I'm a Huge fan of strong , Bold dark roasted Coffee and Black Tiger delivers.",5
"Having a lactose intolerance, I've tried multiple egg proteins as well as some Whey Isolate proteins as well. This is hands down the best tasting protein powder out there. Vanilla and Chocolate are both delicious (I would stay away from Strawberry, it has a strange artificial taste to it, this was the updated formula too so they still haven't worked it out). I prefer to mix with some Vanilla Coconut milk and it's actually something I look forward to drinking (as opposed to some that I had just choked down as quickly as I could). I have also mixed in a teaspoon of cinnamon with just water and the vanilla protein and it is good as well.<br /><br />Another plus is that it uses stevia instead of artificial sweeteners such as sucralose or aspartame.<br /><br />If you can't handle Whey/Casein protein then I would absolutely recommend this one (even if you can but want to try something else). Best bang for your buck compared to other egg proteins and the taste is actually good.",5
"This is the best one we have found for our Kuerig Brewer........everyone loves it. Kids, husband, and me!",5
Don't know why this is here as I never purchased this item.,1
"The thing I like about the senior Greenies is that they seem a little bit softer than regular Greenies, so they are easier on my dogs' teeth (I have 6 dogs, 5 seniors and only my 9-toothed senior Doxie doesn't eat them).",5
"This is the only way to get the benefits from Green Tea. The blend of spices is so good. I like it iced with Truvia. Easy to drink and refreshing. A great tea to take on the go. Can't say enough. I found it at my local Albertson's Grocery, but am anxious to use the convenience with Amazon.",5
"These are pods, designed to be used in a single-cup brewing system made for pods.  I don't have one of those expensive, pod-using, coffeemakers.  I do have a single mug coffeemaker, which I normally fill with water using the provided fourteen ounce mug.  For the purposes of this product, I tried just putting in a cup (8 oz) of water, and placing the pod in the basket.  This produced a weak, undrinkable liquid.  The second time, I filled the pot with 8 oz. again.  I cut open two of the pods and put the coffee in the usual No. 2 filter.  This produced a very strong, but very delicious cup of coffee.  I thought it was too strong even for me at first (I like strong, dark coffee, and drink it black) but the more I drank it, the more I liked it.  I finished every drop.  Filling the one-cup coffeemaker with the usual full mug of water and the contents of two opened pods makes a slightly weaker but still very full-bodied, rich coffee.",5
This coffee actually smells and tastes like it has a shot of Bailey's.  I like drinking it with a bit of artificial sweetener and whipped cream.  Both bring out the taste.  This K-cup has a flavor unlike any other k-cup.  Try it if you like Bailey's and are looking for a unique coffee.,4
"I rescued my dog a year ago. Ever since then, I've been feeding him Newman's. I like that the main ingredient is a form of meat and there isn't a lot of grain type of ingredients. All of the ingredients are organic, so it's really good for my dog. I've tried several other brands with my dog. But I don't think he's really allergic to anything or has a distaste for anything in particular. And since this is one of the cheaper brands out there that is still nutritious, I decided to stick to this brand. Ordering it on Amazon is very convenient because I can use the Subscribe & Save feature and set the schedule of when I want the dog food delivered. I never have to worry about running out of dog food!",5
"This tastes exactly like that Reggie! Candy bar made by baseball player Reggie Jackson in the late 70s, and If you've never had this before, you don't know what you're missing. I haven't found this candy anywhere else, so it's pretty rare. Please try this out if you havent tried it before, because it is DELICIOUS!",5
"The description of the item is ""small pieces, diced.""  I would call them chopped. They're basically what you'd find on a banana split or a sundae or perhaps decorating a chocolate cake or cupcake.  I like the toasted flavor and put them on oatmeal.  They do not come in a sealed package as shown in the photo.  Mine came in a folded over plastic bag inside a cardboard box.",3
Have fond memories of eating at The Original Bookbinders in Center City Philadelphia and enjoying the seafood bisque. My wife moved to Colorado Springs and I to someplace in the Appalachian Mountains. I spend Thanksgiving out west and finally found this soup on Amazon. It will bring a classy soup to the Front Range. Sent a case of it to her. Her mom is native Colorado and wanted to go home to die. Alas she now has a bf from California..It is going to be the best Thanksgiving ever. Thanks Amazon for offering this product.,5
"Our cocker spaniel is now nearly 10 years old, and the solid gold food I'd been feeding him suddenly changed its formulation over a year ago(with no notice on the packaging), and he became subject to unexplained stomach upsets.  After the contaminated food scare even tho Solid Gold was not recalled, I decided to switch, and this formulation is perfect for him to not gain too much weight.  Newman's own is a brand I totally trust and have bought snacks for my human baby as well for years.  After a year on this food, my dog is doing fine, but I do notice a need to supplement with fish oil for a healthier coat.  That may be age related as well.  But the stomach upsets have stopped.  And I feel better knowing I am not exposing him to additional pesticides and hormones by going mostly organic with this formula.",4
I have some incredibly picky dogs and they love these treats.  The pieces are nice and small.  I reccommend this to even the most finicky of dogs.  My dogs have had no digestive issues with them.,5
"My husband and I are coffee snobs and have always ground our beans fresh in the morning. We bought this to take along on camping trips because we wanted to try something better than instant coffee while backpacking. We were so surprised when this turned out to be so good! This is so much cheaper than buying coffee out and super convenient when all you have is a microwave and a cup, also the flavor is full and robust. I will definitely always have this on hand at my home and office. Try it, it is really quite delicious!",5
"I'm a big fan of green tea and I just recently discovered Harney & Sons, Chinese Flower Green Tea.  The smell of the tea sachet (and the tin) is outstanding.  Then when you pour the water over the bag, beautiful colors in the sachet make the experience even more enjoyable.  I'm not usually very effusive about tea, but I feel like drinking this tea is an 'experience' rather than a hot beverage.  The tea tastes as smooth and wonderful as it smells and now I'm not sure I can ever go back to the ho hum stuff I was drinking before! This is the type of tea you make to warm up your body, but then as you drink it you wind up just looking out the window and getting lost in your thoughts.  It's great stuff!",5
"Great tasting mints!  Not to spicy or hot, just right.  Great to know it is organic and the Newman name helps since money from the sale is used to help kids.  Price is reasonable and I love the packaging, easy to carry and find in your pocketbook (at least for women).",5
"This is really good coffee. My family and I can't even tell that it is instant or even decaf. Since it is organic, it seems that it is much smoother than non-organic, but tasting just as strong as normal coffee. Someone said that they didn't think it was better than Starbucks via, but I think it is a ton better. Starbucks via has that grainy taste because they actually use grounds in their instant coffee, but not with freeze dried. Again, this coffee is really good!",5
Great taste & available in a multipack. It's delicious in yogurt. It would be nice if Bob's offered a granola sampler. I guess I'll just have try 'em all.,5
I enjoy the ginger taste of this candy.  And it really helps settle my stomach.  I had originally bought it in a store but found it at Amazon at a much better price.,5
"We adopted our 1.5 year old dog- Lady Pippy Waffles - from the local Humane Society last June 2010. We were told by lots of friends that WE HAVE TO find a holistic dog food because the dogs poops less, and its more solid- sorry for the details! When we first brought Lady home, she was on Science Diet. She had constant diarrhea. I finally did some research and learned that dogs can have a allergy to chicken- which caused the pooping problem- ugh. So we initially put her on another brand- which was great too, but about $15 more a bag. We have found that for the money- EARTHBORN was a great choice for Lady!  Be aware that when you open this bag of food, you will smell nothing but fish- but our dog loves, loves, LOVES IT!  Plus she only poops once a day, and has a gorgeous coat- (just not gorgeous when its all over my couch)!  Thanks!!!",5
"Here's a product that had the potential to be excellent but isn't.  Since it's not a ""K-Cup"", they're not paying the licensing fees, so it should be cheaper.  Yet it's about the same price as many brands of K-Cups.  What makes it worse is that these aren't even ""extra bold"" portions, the ones with extra coffee in the cup, which again you can get for about the same price as these.<br /><br />On the positive side, there's less material here, so less waste generated.  I've bought this brand of coffee in bean form for years, the ""not a K-Cup"" version does deliver the familiar tastes.  A small cup of the same taste.",3
I make my own nut milk taste better than buying the ones at the supermarket. Forget almond breeze make it yourself and you can add vanilla extract for flavor.,5
"I'm not really sure why anyone, especially an avid sparkling water drinker, would claim that this is similar to medicine in flavor or texture.<br /><br />This is a nice product and I would highly recommend it to anyone - even those that may be weary of drinking sparkling water.<br /><br />Personally, I've been looking for alternatives to sugary soda products, but I can't live without carbonation. I really enjoy is product because it's not sweetened and it is a convenient size to take in a lunch. Overall, this is one of my favorite sparkling waters. I would definitely recommend trying their other flavors as well.",5
"This is the most unique dog treat I've seen. The liquid treat is dispensed from a container that reminds me of a large lip gloss tube with a roller. I've given this unique dog treat ""4 stars"" instead of five as an average based on the varied reactions from my two small dogs. The smaller Malti-poo loved the treat and from his reaction would give it ""5 stars"". He immediately licked the roller, received the treat, and wanted more. Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniel is a pickier eater in general and wouldn't even try it at first. He finally did, but didn't seem to like it. We have the chicken flavor and it may be he just didn't like the flavor.<br /><br />Since our Malti-poo likes it so much, I have just ordered the three-pack that has chicken, liver, and bacon flavors. The three-pack is a better value than the individual packs and I'm hoping our Cavalier will like one of the other flavors better than the chicken. This is a unique idea to reward dogs with a treat without filling them up like traditional dog treats.<br /><br />** Update:  I ordered the three-pack and my Cavalier definitely likes the bacon flavor much better than chicken!",4
"This is a terrific olive oil. I am pretty picky with EVOO, and often buy higher priced stuff. I admit to pouring it into a class olive oil container for easier use, but it's well worth the small effort. I highly recommend this to anyone who likes quality olive oil at a terrific price!",5
"These cookies were not bad, but they weren't really good either.  I was happy to find that they are very soft.  I prefer soft cookies.  The chocolate taste does come through.  However, the cookies are also a little gritty or sandy; the texture is very odd.  Also there is something in them that tastes a little off.  I've definitely had much better cookies like Soft Batch and Mrs. Fields.  For the price, they're not bad, but there are much better cookies out there.",3
"""Soba"" is a noodle made from buckwheat flour, and is one of my favorite Japanese foods.  If I lived somewhere in east or west coast, I could find Japanese food restaurant where I can eat it.  However, it have been only the way to use dried noodle here.  Once I tried to make ""soba"" with a buckwheat flour found in a store, it was ground whole buckwheat including pellicle and inner skin. It's flavor was ""soba"" but contained too much fibers.  Then I had given up to make it until I get this.<br />This flour is from good part of buckwheat, and suitable to make ""soba"" noodle.  I'm enjoying making ""soba"" with this flour on each weekend.<br />This flour is not ""sa-ra-si-na"" (in Japanese) that is a flour using the most inner starch rich part, but ""ichiban ko"" (1st grade flour) or ""nami ko"" (general purpose flour).  ""Soba"" from this flour becomes ""Edo mae"" (Tokyo style).  If this has little bit more of inner skin (or pellicle), I can make ""Inaka soba"" (country style), I like more than ""Edo mae"".",4
"Excellent flavor-properly done French Roast. Smokey and rich. Sufficiently strong,  though I always think k -cups need more coffee in them.",4
"Larry's Beans were given to me at Christmas as sort of a Joke ( I go by ""Larry"")  but I was blown away!  Way better that that other brand from Washington state.  Never burned, always smooth.  I have tried 9 different types of Larry's Beans and have never been disappointed.  Even the decaf (Sammy Decaf Jr) is terrific.  I will continue to use it and give as a unique gift.",5
"To be clear, I'm reviewing the cinnamon oat cluster flavor only.<br /><br />This stuff tastes great, although if you're used to the kind of granola that comes in brand-name cereal boxes at the supermarket, its ""earthy,"" natural-grocery-store taste might take a little getting used to.",4
"I have lived in and visited Korea off and on for the last 20 years.<br /><br />I have been cooking Korean food (over 100 recipes) during that time.<br /><br />This is a good sauce.  It isn't as complex as making it yourself, but it is a good, no time substitute.<br /><br />I have tried about 10 different bottled sauces and this is by far the best on the market.  It is not sickly sweet, and by using a little more than suggested it can be as hot as you want it to be.<br /><br />I guess the best compliment I can give it is that it is the best of all the bottles sauces available.",4
"This is decent tasting for a canned chili.  However, the people who say it's hot obviously don't eat a lot of spicy food.  I'd put it in a low medium heat category for chili.",4

"I have been using loose teas for many years.  However, Davidson's Organic South Sfrican Rooibos tea was cut so thin that a lot of the tea and sediment goes right through most tea infusers. Actually, the Rooibos tea seemed to be cut for tea bag use and was accidently placed in the wrong container. I would question the company before ordering.  PS: Since I ordered the tea from Amazon.com, they stood behind by complaint and rectified the problem immediatly. Never a problem when dealing with Amazon.com.

"Seems most people love these Orgain shakes.  This fact really, really makes me wonder.  I don't normally like to leave negative reviews of anything, but I feel it's my duty to express my difference of opinion.  I have tried only the ""chocolate"", and I use quotation marks because it tastes like no chocolate I have ever tasted in my entire life, and I'm a girl who knows her way around chocolate.  It was absolutely the most disgusting protein drink I have ever tasted.  If you put bark mulch, lawn clippings and a little bit of manure in a blender with milk and drank it - that might be a close comparison to the taste of this stuff, in my humble opinion.  I can't even believe I spent money on these, or that anyone else does.  Maybe if you're one of those people who drinks wheatgrass or eats carob like it's really chocolate, or one of those other ""healthy"" and a way too earthy concoctions, you'll like it.  If you have normal tastebuds, run - don't walk -  the other way from this stuff.",1
These are very much like Sunshine Raisin Biscuits that are not longer manufactured--only better. Just wish I could buy them in the U.S.<br />Keebler are you listening??,5
I HAD PURCHASED THIS CANDY WHEN ON VACATION TWO YEARS AGO.  IT TASTED SO GOOD THAT I WENT ON LINE TO LOCATE SOME MORE.  IT TASTES LIKE ICED TEA WITH HONEY.  AND AMAZON.COM HAD THE BEST PRICE.,5
"Until I started drinking this tea, I had not had a ""normal, natural"" period in years.  I had to induce my period with Rx drugs about every three months or so.  Since I started the tea in October 2010 (5-6 months now), I have had THREE natural periods, and have not had to induce even once.  That is amazing!  I also have a general increase in energy since I started drinking it, and have reduced my coffee intake to just one cup daily because of it.<br /><br />Unlike other reviewers, I don't love the taste... it tastes a bit like a celery tonic to me... however, I am slowly acquiring the taste and even if I wasn't I would still drink it for the health benefits, which are truly amazing.",5
Royal Canin has provided my animals with excellent quality food for many years.  My cats are very satisfied and that makes me a happy camper:),5
I got this as presents for several people.  They all said it is really good.  The only frustration is that the online form doesn't have an option to include a gift card.  That would have made my Christmas shopping much easier and earned this nut mix a five star rating.  They should also show the amount per package.,3
This is the KIND bar that made me look into all the varieties I could find. It's healthful and delicious and not too sweet. It's a chocoholic's dream,5
"I used to never feed my cats wet food because they preferred dry and I thought it was fine as long as they drank plenty of water.  After losing one cat to death mysteriously and another one to kidney disease I decided to follow the advice of many on the web and switch to wet food.  I tried many brands including the most expensive, but my three cats prefer Whiskas Purrfectly Fish and Purrfectly Chicken to all others.  I mix them together in the bowl.  All three of my cats run to the bowls to gobble up the food and they don't leave a morsel.  Also, my cats do not throw up this food like they do dry food.  I can't believe the change in their health.  In just a short time my two older boys went from being round fatties to having shape and nice healthy curves.  And their coats are absolutely gorgeous.  The oils in the food obviously create a nice sheen.  Also, the shedding is way down.  Thanks Whiskas and keep it comin'.",5
"Very good tea.  Pleasant smell, mild taste, but it lemon is definitely boss here.  Berry Zinger has a more balanced flavor.",4
My dog absolutely loves this food! He is such a finicky eater and I seriously have to coax and bribe him into trying new foods and yet this one he took to immediately! I was so pleased that he took to it right away and finished the whole bowl! He always leaves more than half and now he eats it all and is satisfied. So happy that I tried this brand!,5
"This sounded SO good I ordered a double box. It is bitter, doesn't taste anything like chocolate, much less glazed donut. It has a TEENY bit of aroma of chocolate glazed donut but all those sweet vibrations get blasted right into the dark zone the MOMENT your tongue touches this coffee ... hard to explain how awful it is. I thought maybe it was just me but my husband actually came after me wanting to know what was wrong with that coffee ... I packed it up the same day and sent it back.<br /><br />Just don't buy it, that's all I have to say.",1
Supposed to be for cleaning their teeth - right...  well - that would assume they held up to some for of chewing...  our little Border TERRIER (not Collie) "eats" one of these in about 5 minutes...  too fast to be of any use to the teeth and almost too fast to cause concern in the digestive tract.  Bummer too because these are supposed to be great for pups teeth...  just an agressive chewer defeats Greenie...  that's all.,2
"I baought these at my local Rite AId store on sale. These are the saltiest and worst chips I have every had!  Awful, will  never buy these again! I like the barbecue ones but not these!",1
This is great oatmeal especially considering it only takes 45 seconds in the microwave. The Apple Cinnamon has tart apple chunks that heat in the bottom of the cup and there is just enough sweetness and cinnamon to make it great. The Peach and Vanilla is a great taste as well. I didn't think it sounded appealling but I gave it a try and it ROCKS!!,5
"These bars are tasty and delicious.  You get 20 bars for a decent price (depending if you do subscribe and save).  These bars are great for my little ones, they love them, and they are a good healthy alternative to candy or cookies.",5
"This brand of tomato soup is probably the yummiest. I have been loyal to the brand, rarely, if ever changing brands. It tastes so natural and can be used for those moments where you are hungry but don't quite know what to eat. Good to dip white bread in or saltine crackers. Very filling, too!",5
I can't imagine starting my day with out my first cup of Caribou Daybreak Morning Blend Coffee.  It has a excellent taste.,5
"This was a great price. However, I didn't realize that there were 4 teabags per envelope.  I would much prefer singles.",4
"We purchased these for our teething 6 month old.  She really enjoyed it for about a minute before a piece broke off and she started choking on it.  We had to flip her upside down and pat her on her back to dislodge it from her throat.  The title of teething biscuits is a bit misleading, they should really just sell them as biscuits for children who are already eating solids.",1
"Last week I ordered these pigears and I am so happy.  Before I was purchasing pigears from the hardware store,  they were nice but I was paying 1.60 for each one and sometimes they were small.  I have two bulldogs and before I leave for work I will give them one so I go through a lot.  I will save money and will not have to worry about running out.",5
"I have gone through many brands of cat food for my Maine Coon mix female. She's about five years old now. I discovered this food first at a boutique type pet store... I was looking for our regular Eukanuba brand. This fancy place only had some pricey food, including Royal Canin, which I was not familiar with. I bought it anyway since I had never seen food especially for the Maine Coon breed. Well, our cat Vita loved it. She can't just scarf this food down and then throw up like she does with other food! She eats it properly and, amazingly, does not leave food in the dish. Her favorite trick is to always leave food behind and then complain that it's stale. For instance, with the Paul Newman food, she eats a few bites and then walks away. Then she comes back and camps out by her dish waiting for a few more ""fresh"" morsels. When I give her Iams, she gobbles her food like a little demon. Then I go to work or do some chores and voila, I find a pile of thrown-up kibble on the carpet. Of course, I try giving her small doses of kibble... boy, does this cat eat a lot. She is very healthy though and not too fat. The main point of my review is: so far Royal Canin Maine Coon 31 Formula is proving to be the right food for this big girl.<br /><br />Other important points: The price through Amazon is much better than through the pet store. The convenience of finding it online versus not knowing where the heck it might be stocked is wonderful. The most surprising thing was shipping was super fast. I ordered on Saturday night and got it Monday afternoon. How did they do that? I've never experienced such fast FREE shipping with Amazon. Also, I paid no extra sales tax. I really hope to keep this up and have the same experience. You can't beat this.",5
"I have a few favorites when it comes to K-cups, and <a href=""http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004779XNW"">Green Mountain Coffee Dark Magic, 24-Count K-Cups for Keurig Brewers</a> is among them. It brews a consistently good, strong cup of coffee for those who prefer a bold taste. It isn't burdened with any fancy flavors, just a deep and intense taste that satisfies nicely.",4
"I have been using this product for almost a week now and my only complaint is that I didn't find pit about it sooner! First, a bit about myself. I am a 45 year old black woman, suffering from gout, constipation, fibrmyalgia, muscle cramps, brain fog and horrible insomnia, along with chronic depression and yes I am overweight, yes folks I am a hot mess!<br /><br />I found out about CALM from an article about the five vitamins and supplements that our bodies need the most, I was already taking four of them, so that made me feel good and when I read about CALM, I was like great this may be just what I need, especially after I read about all of the possible benefits that were to be achieved after taking CALM.<br /><br />Well, let me tell you how it has helped me in under a week. I am sleeping through the night, my mood is improving and that in of it self is a miracle. I have been suffering from depression for over 20 years and nothing helped, this is helping. I am able to think a bit clearer and turn off my brain, which in turn is also helping me sleep!<br /><br />Another major benefit is relief of muscle pain and cramps, especially after exercising! I did a particularly tough workout the other day, well hell any workout when you're fat can be tough, but this one consisted of weight training, cardio and ab work. I fully expected that I would be in horrible pain the next morning, but I wasn't as a matter of fact, I felt great! This also, seems to be helping with my fibromyalgia too.<br /><br />Now, the biggest benefit so far is the relief from my contipation! If I went once a week, I considered myself lucky. I had tried everything under the sun to get things moving so to speak, and either it would work for a while and then nothing, or worse yet nothing would happen at all. Any one that has suffered from constipation, knows now horrible it can be and how miserable you can become, both emotionally and physically. Well, since I have been taking CALM, I go two sometimes three times a day! I feel so much lighter, my friends and family always said I was full of crap and I guess they were right!<br /><br />I guess after reading my review you are thinking either she is being paid for this or it really works, well it is definitely the latter! It is working for me and I believe it will work for you too, try it what have you got to lose besides a crappy mood, sleepless night, a lot of crap and cramps? Jeez, I think $23.00 is a pretty fair trade off don't you.<br /><br />One more thing the dosage that I am using is two teaspoons at night and one teaspoon in the morning, both with 3 teaspoons of benefiber mixed in  girl still needs her fiber! and BTW it's a store brand). I hope this review helps and if you have any questions please contact me, I am real and this review is real!",5
"I purchased due to one of the review saying this was much better than yoki tea,I feel this tea has a bitter taste and not much ginger,in fact I added ginger,which did not help the taste at all.",2

"Have used the trap for a month carefully following directions. Have tried a new location every few days. Have not caught a single mole. Meanwhile, the yard fills with more and more tunnels. Don't expect success and you won't be disappointed.",1
I am a licorice junkie so buy it quite often. I did manage to send some to our troops only because I sent it out right away or I would have gobbled it up.,5
This another of the GJ coffee selections I have purchased for the Keurig.  Good flavoring in the one also...,5
"On the plus side, they get the flavor and carbonation right here.  One fears a Tang taste, but it's more subtle than that and the bubbles are likewise discrete enough that it's no Fizzy-Lifting Drink.<br /><br />On the downside though, one would prefer a sharper after taste to the sort of syrupy way it stays on the tongue.",3
Lindt 70% was easily the best dark chocolate on the market. We tried the new recipe ...once. That was it. I emailed customer service and they said their marketing showed that the new stuff would sell better. And they sent me a coupon for more Lindt.<br /><br />They lost a customer.,1

"I have become a big fan of hot tea since buying my Keurig a few months ago and since I've always loved Chai Lattes, I thought this would be great.  It did not live up to expectations.  While the aroma is wonderful (spicy, warm and sweet), the taste is watery and leaves an after taste like bad artificial sweetener.  And it is heavy on the sweet.  I tried a couple of cups and didn't finish either.  I wish Keurig could come up with a latte K-Cup that tastes like Latte.  I love all the coffees, teas and even the hot cider but anything that I've tried that should have had a creamy consistency like hot chocolate, white hot chocolate or this chai latte have all been watery and unpleasant.  So, for now at least, I'm sticking to just the tea and adding my own milk or cream.",2
"Wet food is to cats what drugs are to addicts...I swear my 2 cats go insane every time we walk near their stack of cat-food cans.<br /><br />I like these better than the origional patte Friskies because they don't smell nearly as bad, and they are much easier to mix with dry food (my cats split half a can mixed with dry food each morning).",5
"A decadent go to treat!! Nice to keep around the house for quick meals, toss them in homemade ice cream for a yummy flavor or just grab one when you have a sweet tooth!",4
I have been using this salt since the 70's. Has a unique salt/deep green leafy veggie & celery flavor that makes ordinary food special without changing character of dish.  Especially good on popcorn.  Only shake a tiny little bit out until you know how it works.  Holes are large and let too much salt flow thru if not careful.,5
I love this product it keep me out of the store buying milk all the time.,5
I found this in a local health food store and was very pleased with the product.  The ability to save money by setting up repeated delivery was all the incentive I needed.  This is a great way to purchase regularly used health products.,5
"It doesn't taste like walnuts, plain and simple. It tastes like paper glue loaded with alcohol. And I got heartburns afterwards. Who knows what is in this. I really regret buying this, what a waste of money.",1
"I purchased the BACK TO NATURE crispy oatmeal cookies locally.  They were delicious.  The cookies were no longer available locally so I purchased cookies through Amazon as directed by the BACK TO NATURE website.  The cookies are disgusting.  They are not the same cookies that I purchased locally.  BACK TO NATURE must get rid of their rejected cookies through Amazon.  Since I cannot return the cookies, they are now in the garbage. I will never again purchase any product from BACK TO NATURE.",1
"Before I start, let me say that I am somewhat of a gourmand. Sure, I dont indulge in caviar and foie gras, but I love food. Although my eating habits and conquests are still in their nascent stages, I always jump at a chance to savour some classic specialties. These Walker shortbreads being one of them. I did my research, and found that these were some of the finest shortbreads to be had. After ordering and now having tried them, I can tell you that while they are surely rich and relatively tasty, they are not exactly what I expected. I was hoping for them to be better than any shortbread cookie I have ever tried, but in this respect they didnt live up to my expectations. It is, however, a relatively good accompaniment to some delicious Earl Grey tea.",4
"Good tasting, produces good crema. This is a fine grind, which is perfect for La Pavoni handle pull machines. Pack the basket tight and you'll get a gorgeous, rich shot. I also like the relatively smalll amount of waste the foil pack generates relative to products packed in cans.",5
"I was introduced to Lavazza coffee in Victoria, BC.  Everyone who visits me loves it.  I make it in a regular coffee maker, not an expresso machine, and drink it for my regular morning coffee.  I am thinking of getting an expresso maker just for it.",5
The product seemed fresh on arrival but is sort of 'gummy' in texture. Didn't taste very good so I just threw it away.,2
Item shipped fast. Taste delicious. This is the second that I bought Graroto here. Highly recommend this to those love Brazil chocolates.,5
"I bought this toy for my 9 month old lab and had to return this twice. My dog loved it, but he dropping it on our hardwood floors and the bottom twist off part broke with each one. Good concept but plastic too brittle. Company does stand behind it, just not good for my dog.",2
"My 5-star rating is in comparison to other K-Cups I've had, not compared to beans just ground and brewed in my Technivorm Moccamaster. Having said that, this is still a satisfying cup of coffee. My wife was drinking Coffee People Donut Shop as her everyday cup, has switched to this. For me the DS was OK, but I favor the darker brews like Paul Newman Extra Bold and the Van Houtte Eclipse. I like this Fog Chaser quite a bit better, and it's a great bonus how much less plastic waste the cups create. On top of that, they're cheaper, so extra bonus. If you like strong, but not bitter, coffee, this is definitely worth trying.",5
"I have been using this for a while. 3 Bottles worth. One of the most frequent ways I use this is on steaks. Just Sprinkle a little of this and some fresh ground pepper on both sides. Then Grill them. The steaks come out REALLY good. I don't even use Steak sauce with them. They taste too good to muddle up with a sauce. I have used this many, many other ways. For some reason The only place around here that carried it , STOPPED carrying it. This will be my first Amazon purchase of it. But I'll have 6 bottles of it...I can already taste the steaks...Mmmm",5
"Anyone who thinks it's crazy to pay ~$.70 for a package of ramen has definitely never had this. It's worth every penny. Sure, you can buy that ""other"" ramen at 20 for a buck at the grocery store. But nothing compares to this delicious spicy ramyun soup.<br /><br />Disclaimer: I had the Korean vegetarian version with the cute little raccoon on the front. The packaging was orientated landscape instead of portrait as well.",5
"I was disappointed in this product because I thought it would be bigger.<br />Also, it did not come with enough icing. I had to use my own.",2
"I was buying those exact 100% same container, ingredients & taste with a slightly different sticker name on top from Wholefoods for almost $7 after tax.<br />This is a sweet deal at $17.71 for 4 packs of 8oz containers. The only other place I know one can get those is at Harry's Farmers Market in the Atlanta and surrounding area.",5
Perfect filling breakfast for me.  I'm an on the go working Mom and it's tough having something to grab for breakfast that has a decent amount of protein.  I throw it in the microwave for 20 seconds and it's a nice hot filling breakfast.  I highly recommend keeping this in your pantry for those days you need something fast and tasty!,5
Great tasting and easy to prepare in the microwave.  Healthy breakfast choice!  Good value for organic oat bran product yet it has a decent shelf life.,5
Pomi tomatoes do taste great but I would like if they were organic.  Natural is nice but certified organic would be an even better option.,4
This is the best food i've ever used for my dogs!! Pedigree is easy to digest an the flavor must be good they can't wait to eat !!!!!,5
"I am so happy I found this product! Charlie can break through almost any toy but not this one. I was very surprised by how thick the ""jug"" is (I purchased the large.) He loves chewing on the rope which is rubber and so far it has not been broken. The dry food I put inside comes out in the right amount, it doesn't fall out like some toys and it is not to difficult like others. I am very very happy and recommend this toy to anyone with a dog that likes to chew and needs to be kept busy.",5
These cookies arrived quickly and were packaged well. Loved all 3 kinds. Nice to have cookies you don't have to feel guilty about. Great taste.,5
"BEWARE! These are the very small boxes that sell for $2 elsewhere, even on Amazon. Do not pay more than $4 for two.",1
"I ordered this jerky to try it out as an alternative to BEEF jerky. I knew, going in, that Oberto made really tastey beef jerky. Well now I know that they make really good turkey jerky too. I have this on subscription and I have been getting an 'extra delivery' quite often. It tastes so good that once I open the package, I eat the whole thing. It has a sweet taste that I can understand might be overwhelming to some, but for me, it's perfect. I plan on keeping this on subscription. Try it. You won't be disappointed!",5
"I love organic coconut oil and feel it is a must in our diet. I just couldn't stomach the $16 price tag from Whole Foods anymore for the exact same product. I received it today, it has the exact same exp date on the package (I know that is an issue with some items on Amazon, products being too close to the exp date and maybe that is why you got it at a bargain price).<br />Came well packaged with the seal intact, no problems. I will buy it again from this seller. And with Amazon Prime, it makes it a super bargain!<br />Also, if you are doing your research on the many amazing properties coconut oil possesses, you know that it is anti-bacterial. I discovered almost 3 yrs ago that I was allergic to antiperspirant/deo. My armpits would itch and I would scratch them almost raw. When I stopped using anti/deo, the itch stopped. Looking around online, this happens to many people. What to do? Well, I went to Whole Foods and bought plenty of natural deos that did not work AT ALL! Good for me they take back anything, including used deo. I researched and found a recipe for coconut oil deo. It has cornstarch, baking soda, and coconut oil. I followed a recipe, (google coconut oil deodorant recipe) formed it into an old deo container, and what do you know? It works like a charm! NO ODOR! It does not stop sweat, but guess what folks? You are supposed to sweat under your armpits, it is your body's way of detoxifying itself. Sweat smells when the bacteria from the skin and the perspiration meet in a dark, warm place- the armpit. The EVCO inhibits the production of bacteria. You have a serious amount of lymph nodes there that need the freedom to move toxins out of your body. And we wonder why women get breast cancer more and more these days. When I have important social events or meeting I use a regular antiperspirant, but 90% of the time I use this. Keep in fridge in warmer climates, it melts at 76 degrees F.<br /><br />Coconut oil is truly amazing stuff, give it a try. Can't hurt.",5
"I love the chocolate brownies that i've ordered from this company, but to me - the blondies seem wayyy undercooked.  I know people love brownies moist and chewy, but to me they seem doughy and almost like raw cookie dough.<br /><br />They have candies on them and caramel etc., and i feel they are a good product and company - it's just that i like my blondies cooked longer!  I am going to try to bake one in the oven, altho i know parts of it will melt.",2
I use these to snack on when I get that chip craving. They are a little greasy but more healthy and I love the taste.,5
"I have been getting into the Ito En green teas and have primarily been drinking the traditional green, jasmine and dark green.  I wanted to try some new flavors and bought a bottle of this at my local Whole Foods to try first.  Man, this is really good!  The mint is very subtle but refreshing!  It lends itself to a sweet finish that I really enjoy...I am motivated to buy a case because it livens up the regular green tea I have been drinking so much of.  I wish I had tried it sooner!",5
I used to love the old Zico when it went straight from the coconut into the container.  Now that it's made from concentrate it tastes weak and spoiled.  This will be my last box of ever of Zico.  I'll be going back to O.N.E. or Vita Coco.,1
"This is great, healthy food---the only food my dogs (Cav. Spaniel and Spaniel mix) can eat w/o stomach issues. Many other premium foods are just too rich!!  The dented can issue has never required me to return the food, but it happens too often and is very annoying!  I would never feed my dogs anything else and no one here carries this particular food, so I am very thankful that Amazon sells it.",5
"An old favourite, that is finally going to be available in the US.<br /><br />This cereal is very much a Frosted Flakes type cornflake with a hint of honey flavour and shredded peanuts in the glaze. The peanut is very finely shredded and a roughly the size of finely-shredded coconut.  This small size enables it to be evenly distributed onto the cornflakes with the glaze.  The overall effect is a tasty honey-scented sweet cornflake that is extra crunchy and slightly peanuty. [See photos above]<br /><br />However, my SO was quite disappointed when opening the bag to not find whole, half or at least long pieces of crushed peanut, although there was a strong peanut scent. He had expected a nut & cornflake version of Raisin Bran.",4
"Excellent product, very well constructed, It has capacity for more K-cups, so can't go wrong choosing this one against the one made by Keurig",5
I have been making black tea in my bodum iced tea pitcher and wanted to try a nice loose green. This one works perfectly. It has a mild taste that is very fresh.,4
"I ordered this for making Taco Seasoning Mix. I guess I wasn't thinking when I ordered a pound of it.<br /><br />I will have Oregano for the next 5 years. It came well packaged, and now lives in my freezer untill I need it again.<br /><br />Was very pleased with the how fresh it seemed to be.",5
"I am not a huge coffee drinker, so for me the best cappuccino is one that doesn't have a strong coffee taste. . .I actually prefer the gas station variety over the 'real deal'.  If that's what you like, then this is the perfect fit!  I love it, my husband loves it as well, and he was quite skeptical!  We purchased an actual cappuccino maker several years ago and hated the strong coffee taste, so the machine went back to the store.  He refused to believe me, that this mix was what we were looking for, until I made him a cup!  He's surprised and happy to have a cheaper way to make a favorite drink at home w/out having to stop on the way to work!",5
"This melts in your mouth, couldn't taste any better, love, love, love.  The reason I gave it only three stars it the high price.",3
"I'm in Italy once or twice every year for the past 15, I bring home at least a dozen each time. Mutti brand is about the best I have ever had, I have used it along with my own bottled tomatos from my garden,that are sometimes loaded with water even though I plant San Marzano, roma amd other paste types.<br />You should try Mutti, better than star or co-opp brands.

These kona pods are the highest quality pods that I have found yet. I love kona coffee so I was extremely pleased to find these pods. They certainly cost a little more than other cheap pods but it's worth it especially when you consider what you pay for a cup of coffee at retail. Now I have the best coffee in the world at home for less...,5
This is a healthy and good snack for my dog.  It is a great training produst too.  When you take into account that a couple are all she needs it is a good value.,5

Milka is das beste chokolate in der World. Tastes so very good. pure chocolate and pure milk. It offers a truly unique experience. By far the best I have tasted since I was in South Africa,5
At $30 plus $23 shipping is a bit more than I typically pay ($1.99) at the local market.  Must be aware of pricing before buying anything here.,3
"General Mills CORN Chex ingredients on this site lists ""barley malt extract"", which means that this product is NOT gluten free.<br /><br />Be careful.<br /><br />A version of RICE chex, however, has just been made available where the barley malt ingredient has been replaced with molasses. Thank you General Mills! As always, be sure to read the ingredients on every item you buy, each and every time!",4
"My favorite tea, and it is sometimes hard to find at the grocery store.  Now, I have a stockpile with this big package, I am in heaven!",5
"My dog loves bully sticks and we try to find good natural ones for her to chew on.  They are healthy and good for dog's teeth.  I am very pleased with the purchase, and my dog loves them.  No bad smell when she eats them.  Will definitely buy again!",5
"I bought a pack of 4 and that should say something. I have tried so many different brands of coffee, both foreign and domestic. I don't know how many times I've bought coffee and either gave it away to someone at work or just threw it out. But this coffee was amazing to me from the first cup! It has never disappointed me from one can to the next. It's balanced, aromatic, and flavorful without being over roasted ala Starbucks--which started that trend. Well that's fine if you into quadruple late..Frappuccino, Caramel Macchiato...whatever. I just want a smooth, flavorful cup of coffee thank you. And that is what Melitta 100% Colombian Medium Roast delivers can after can!",5
Earl Grey Tea is my favorite tea & Taylor of Harrogate is my favorite Earl Grey - this one happens to be decaf; so I can enjoy a cup at night & still get to sleep.  I take mine with milk & sugar; as I learned from my time in England.  A perfect treat on a cold night while you read and relax.,5
"Just received the item as a Christmas present. We were on vacation when it arrived so I'm pretty sure it was sitting in our apartment post room for a week. The bamboo survived well with the ""crystal soil.""<br /><br />Unfortunately when I opened it one of the four ceramic vases was broken. Actually, I took this as good luck. In China you should never have things in groups of four... it's bad luck because the word for ""four"" sounds very similar to the word for ""death."" I took the fact that it broke as a sign that the universe was looking out for me. ;)",3
"If you're expecting the stevia flavor to be present, you'll be disappointed. This is not a true stevia sweetener, because it only contains reb A and none of the other compounds found in stevia.<br /><br />Truvia is very similar to another brand called PureVia. They are pretty much equal in quality and flavor. Both are very effective at tasting close to sugar without the typical stevia flavor. Truvia differs from PureVia very slightly. PureVia has a slight creamy flavor, and Truvia is a little sweeter per packet (each packet contains more). Both are primarily sweetened with erythritol and purified reb A (another name for rubiana). Erythritol is a natural nearly zero calorie sweetener found in fruit. Reb A is a natural zero calorie sweetener isolated from stevia leaf. Unlike stevia, which is known for a leafy licorice like aftertaste, Reb A has almost no aftertaste and is intensely sweet. Because it's present in Truvia in isolated form without the other stevia compounds, Truvia tastes nothing like stevia.<br /><br />Truvia contains erythritol, reb A, and natural flavors. PureVia differs in that it also contains isomaltulose and a tiny bit of cellulose powder. One big difference between PureVia, and Truvia is that Truvia contains far more erythritol, so erythritol has more of an impact on the flavor than it does in PureVia. Erythritol tastes more like sugar than reb A does, but it has a watery quality to its flavor and a cooling effect. Reb A has a thin sharp sweetness to it. When the two are combined they greatly enrich each other giving a more full bodied sweetness.<br /><br />Truvia, NuStevia, and PureVia are the best stevia based sweeteners you can get when it comes to stevia sweeteners without the stevia flavor.<br /><br />PureVia tastes better in coffee because it has a creamy flavor. Of course most people love cream in their coffee, so PureVia has an upper hand there because of the creamy flavor present. The creamy flavor of PureVia goes well in some things, but not all things. Truvia is not creamy tasting, is sweeter per packet and is better suited for general purpose sweetening where a creamy flavor might not be desired.<br /><br />I did taste tests with my family using PureVia, Truvia, and Sun Crystals, three of the newest stevia based sweeteners. PureVia and Truvia were liked by everyone with PureVia judged slightly better for things requiring a creamy flavor and Truvia scoring better for things that taste better without a creamy flavor. Sun Crystals has the taste of stevia in it, and for that reason it scored lower, because the flavor of the stevia was a negative in some taste tests. Of the three PureVia tasted the most like sugar, Truvia the most like erythritol, and Sun Crystals the most like stevia. One thing that was interesting during the taste test that we found was that when PureVia was tasted plain after Truvia was tasted plain, PureVia tasted better, likewise when Truvia was tasted plain after PureVia was tasted plain it was judged to taste better, but when tasted together the flavor wasn't as good.<br /><br />If you're looking for an effective all natural zero calorie sweetener, this is about as good as it gets. The taste is very similar to sugar, but like all other sweeteners, it has it's own unique flavor. While PureVia tastes a little more like sugar and has a creamy flavor, it's not as sweet as Truvia. Truvia is a better deal because it's sweeter per packet. The difference in flavor is very minor. Also PureVia relies more on reb A for sweetening than Truvia does. Reb A is great in small amounts, but not so good in large amounts, so when more sweetness power is needed Truvia is a better choice. Very large amounts of reb A will taste bitter, but when used in normal amounts, it doesn't taste bitter. Reb A is similar to saccharin in that way. Small amounts taste better than large amounts. There's a sweetness threshold with reb A, and if that threshold is passed, it starts tasting less sweet and starts tasting bitter. That's one thing you need to know when using a reb A based sweetener. Because Truvia relies more on erythritol for it's sweetness than reb A, this is not as much of a problem as it can be with PureVia. You can use far more Truvia packets before you get a flavor ""overdose"" of reb A than with PureVia.",5
Great snack product.  Unusual fusion of flavors.  They offer other flavors and combinations as well.  Quick service and good pricing.,5
While my dogs do like the chews the picture is misleading. The actual package is small and so are the chews ( even the large size)<br />My dogs' breath is a bit better but I'm not sure they are worth the price.<br />I'll be trying other brands.,3
let me tell you that this beef jerky has me wanting more. I have never tasted a jerky with more flavor and taste I recommend it to anyone wanting a little more out of their jerky.. A++++++++++++,5
OK.  So the back of the box says add 2 - 3/4 cups of water.  Doesnt that mean 2 cups and 3/4?  I ended up with soup!  Maybe they mean "2"  "1/2" cups which would be 1 1/2 cup?<br />The flavor seemed good and I like the fact that it is actually 100% whole grain unlike many other boxed pilafs.  Maybe Ill call customer service and see if I read the directions wrong.,3
"Has toxic magnesium stearate and titanium dioxide which is carcinogen.<br />This explains WHY the ingredients are not displayed and you need to BUY a product to see what's in it.<br />TRY Ricochet Mints with Xylitol, Peppermint -- it's THE BEST!<br />All natural and has only THREE ingredients: Xylitol, Gum Arabic, and Peppermint Essential Oil.",1
"Sometimes you want sweet, sometimes you want salty. When you want salty, consider trying these chips.  Substitution is the name of the game when you're wanting to eat healthy and maintain or get to a healthy weight without depriving yourself a nutritionist taught me.  Finding these chips was serendipity!  You can have 20 chips for about 130 calories--about 6 calories per chip!--and they taste as good, if not better, than potato chips.  If popcorn could be made into a chip, this is the result.  I'm eating them as I write this review.  They have no saturated or trans fats, not that high in sodium (only 7% of daily allowance), no cholesterol, not high carb (7%) with 2 g of protein and even a little iron.  What's not to love?  And 20 are very satisfying.  I like dipping them in guacamole.<br /><br />You can pack a bag in your purse or your child's lunch.  As their bag says, they're the new shape of popcorn!  I've lost 30 pounds over the last two years eating healthy and these chips are guilt-free.",5
As a very active person (triathlete) I find these to be an excellent snack to keep my blood sugar up! They taste great chilled!,4
