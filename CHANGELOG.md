1.2
- removed most toy data and forward fns to rdatasets/*
    - attention: column nams of some 'toydatasets' have changed, now in kebak-keyword style
- additional validation of consitency of predict / cat maps 

1.1.1
* cleaned column names from "." in rdatasets
* better initial doc string for rdatasets functions
* new fn 'dataset-descriptions->doc-strings!' to attach dataset description as docsting to all rdadasets functions

1.1
* added access fn to all datasets from https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/articles/data.html


1.0
* use malli to describe model options and validate them in ml/train
* renamed :other-metrices -> :other-metrics

0.12
* fixes #30 - dummy classifier does not predict by majority #30
* added dummy regression model
* improved design-matrix feature . Breaking !  columns need to be refered know by "precise name" (string, symbol, keyword)
* made model  :fastmath/ols frezzable by nippy
 

0.11.1
* allow parameters for :fastmath/ols (fixes #27)
* added optional caching for train / predict
* added new evaluation-handler: metrics-and-model-keep-fn
* added option :ppmap with :ppmap-grain-size 10 to ml/eval-pipelines
* added more evaluation-handler fns suitable for model-spec search
* added :probability-distributin to ml/eval-pipelines result
* breaking: move all eval handler to ns scicloj.metamorph.ml.evaluation-handler

0.10.4
* added :target-datatypes in train result and clarified expected 'shape' of prediction

0.10.3
 * re-added data.json dependency

0.10.2
 * re-added data.csv dependency

0.10.1
 * fixed cljdoc build issue

0.10.0

* exclude most hanami deps as we don't need them
* added support for tidy-text and 
* added read/write support for TMD<->libsvm files
