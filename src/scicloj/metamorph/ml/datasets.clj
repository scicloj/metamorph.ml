Approximately 65,000 randomly\nselected US households are surveyed each month. The sample is chosen by\nrandomly selecting addresses from a database. Details can be found in\nthe Handbook of Labor Statistics and is described on the Bureau of Labor\nStatistics website (<https://www.bls.gov/>).\n\nThe survey conducted each March is more detailed than in other months\nand asks questions about earnings during the previous year. The data\nsets contain data for 2004 (from the March 2005 survey), and some also\nfor earlier years (up to 1992).\n\nIf education is given, it is for full-time workers, defined as workers\nemployed more than 35 hours per week for at least 48 weeks in the\nprevious year.

After that, around the\nage of ten, students are placed into one of three types of secondary\nschool: `\"Hauptschule\"` (lower secondary school), `\"Realschule\"` (middle\nsecondary school), or `\"Gymnasium\"` (upper secondary school). Only a\ndegree from the latter type of school (called Abitur) provides direct\naccess to universities.\n\nA frequent criticism of this system is that the tracking takes place too\nearly, and that it cements inequalities in education across generations.\nAlthough the secondary school choice is based on the teachers\\'\nrecommendations, it is typically also influenced by the parents; both\nindirectly through their own educational level and directly through\ninfluence on the teachers.\n\n### Source\n\nOnline complements to Winkelmann and Boes (2009).\n\n### References\n\nWinkelmann, R., and Boes, S.

was a four-year\nlongitudinal class-size study funded by the Tennessee General Assembly\nand conducted in the late 1980s by the State Department of Education.\nOver 7,000 students in 79 schools were randomly assigned into one of\nthree interventions: small class (13 to 17 students per teacher),\nregular class (22 to 25 students per teacher), and regular-with-aide\nclass (22 to 25 students with a full-time teacher\\'s aide). Classroom\nteachers were also randomly assigned to the classes they would teach.\nThe interventions were initiated as the students entered school in\nkindergarten and continued through third grade.\n\nThe Project STAR public access data set contains data on test scores,\ntreatment groups, and student and teacher characteristics for the four\nyears of the experiment, from academic year 1985--1986 to academic year\n1988--1989. The test score data analyzed in this chapter are the sum of\nthe scores on the math and reading portion of the Stanford Achievement\nTest.\n\nStock and Watson (2007) obtained the data set from the Project STAR Web\nsite.\n\nThe data is provided in wide format. Reshaping it into long format is\nillustrated below. Note that the levels of the `degree`, `ladder` and\n`tethnicity` variables differ slightly between kindergarten and higher\ngrades.\n\n### Source\n\nOnline complements to Stock and Watson (2007).\n\n### References\n\nStock, J.H. and Watson, M.W.

Average proportion of points invested across all 9 rounds.\n\ngender\n\n:   factor. Gender of the player (or team of players).\n\nmale\n\n:   factor. Was (at least one of) the player(s) male (in the team)?\n\nage\n\n:   numeric. Age in years (averaged for teams).\n\ntreatment\n\n:   factor. Type of treatment: long vs. short.\n\ngrade\n\n:   factor. School grades: 6-8 (11-14 years) vs. 10-12 (15-18 years).\n\narrangement\n\n:   factor. Is the player a single player or team of two?\n\n### Details\n\nMyopic loss aversion is a phenomenon in behavioral economics, where\nindividuals do not behave economically rationally when making short-term\ndecisions under uncertainty. Example: In lotteries with positive\nexpected payouts investments are lower than the maximum possible (loss\naversion). This effect is enhanced for short-term investments (myopia or\nshort-sightedness).\n\nThe data in `LossAversion` were collected by Matthias Sutter and Daniela\nGlätzle-Rützler (Universität Innsbruck) in an experiment with\nhigh-school students in Tyrol, Austria (Schwaz and Innsbruck). The\nstudents could invest X points (0-100) in each of 9 rounds in a lottery.\nThe payouts were 100 + 2.5 \\* X points with probability 1/3 and 100 - X\npoints with probability 2/3. Thus, the expected payouts were 100 + 1/6\n\\* X points. Depending on the treatment in the experiment, the\ninvestments could either be modified in each round (treatment:\n\\\"short\\\") or only in round 1, 4, 7 (treatment \\\"long\\\"). Decisions were\neither made alone or in teams of two. The points were converted to\nmonetary payouts using a conversion of EUR 0.5 per 100 points for lower\ngrades (Unterstufe, 6-8) or EUR 1.0 per 100 points for upper grades\n(Oberstufe, 10-12).\n\nFrom the myopic loss aversion literature (on adults) one would expect\nthat the investments of the players (either single players or teams of\ntwo) would depend on all factors: Investments should be\n\n-   lower in the short treatment (which would indicate myopia),\n\n-   higher for teams (indicating a reduction in loss aversion),\n\n-   higher for (teams with) male players,\n\n-   increase with age/grade.\n\nSee Glätzle-Rützler et al. (2015) for more details and references to the\nliterature. In their original analysis, the investments are analyzes\nusing a panel structure (i.e., 9 separate investments for each team).\nHere, the data are averaged across rounds for each player, leading to\nqualitatively similar results. The full data along with replication\nmaterials are available in the Harvard Dataverse.\n\n### Source\n\nGlätzle-Rützler D, Sutter M, Zeileis A (2020).

The original reading accuracy score was\ntransformed by Smithson and Verkuilen (2006) so that `accuracy` is in\nthe open unit interval (0, 1) and beta regression can be employed.\nFirst, the original accuracy was scaled using the minimal and maximal\nscore (`a` and `b`, respectively) that can be obtained in the test:\n`accuracy1 = (original_accuracy - a) / (b - a)` (`a` and `b` are not\nprovided). Subsequently, `accuracy` was obtained from `accuracy1` by\nreplacing all observations with a value of 1 with 0.99.\n\nKosmidis and Zeileis (2024) propose to investigate the original\nunrestricted `accuracy1` variable using their extended-support beta\nmixture regression.\n\n### Source\n\nExample 3 from Smithson and Verkuilen (2006) supplements.\n\n### References\n\nCribari-Neto, F., and Zeileis, A.

Manaus is 18km upstream from the confluence of\nthe Rio Negro with the Amazon but because of the tiny slope of the water\nsurface and the lower courses of its flatland affluents, they may be\nregarded as a good approximation of the water level in the Amazon at the\nconfluence. The data here cover 90 years from January 1903 until\nDecember 1992.\n\nThe Manaus gauge is tied in with an arbitrary bench mark of 100m set in\nthe steps of the Municipal Prefecture; gauge readings are usually\nreferred to sea level, on the basis of a mark on the steps leading to\nthe Parish Church (Matriz), which is assumed to lie at an altitude of\n35.874 m according to observations made many years ago under the\ndirection of Samuel Pereira, an engineer in charge of the Manaus\nSanitation Committee Whereas such an altitude cannot, by any means, be\nconsidered to be a precise datum point, observations have been\nprovisionally referred to it.

In his 1908 paper he\nwrote (on page 13) at the beginning of section VI entitled *Practical\nTest of the forgoing Equations*:\n\n\"Before I had succeeded in solving my problem analytically, I had\nendeavoured to do so empirically. The material used was a correlation\ntable containing the height and left middle finger measurements of 3000\ncriminals, from a paper by W. R. MacDonell (1902, p. 219). The\nmeasurements were written out on 3000 pieces of cardboard, which were\nthen very thoroughly shuffled and drawn at random. As each card was\ndrawn its numbers were written down in a book, which thus contains the\nmeasurements of 3000 criminals in a random order. Finally, each\nconsecutive set of 4 was taken as a sample---750 in all---and the mean,\nstandard deviation, and correlation of each sample determined. The\ndifference between the mean of each sample and the mean of the\npopulation was then divided by the standard deviation of the sample,\ngiving us the *z* of Section III.\"\n\nThe table is in fact page 216 and not page 219 in MacDonell (1902). In\nthe MacDonell table, the middle finger lengths were given in mm and the\nheights in feet/inches intervals, they are both converted into cm here.\nThe midpoints of intervals were used, e.g., where MacDonell has\n`4' 7''9/16 -- 8''9/16`{.reqn}, we have 142.24 which is 2.54\\*56 =\n2.54\\*(`4' 8''`{.reqn}).\n\nMacDonell credited the source of data (page 178) as follows: *The data\non which the memoir is based were obtained, through the kindness of Dr\nGarson, from the Central Metric Office, New Scotland Yard\\...* He\npointed out on page 179 that : *The forms were drawn at random from the\nmass on the office shelves; we are therefore dealing with a random\nsampling.*\n\n### Source\n\n<https://pbil.univ-lyon1.fr/R/donnees/criminals1902.txt> thanks to Jean\nR.

There were 2691 male applicants, of\nwhom 1198 (44.5%) were admitted, compared with 1835 female applicants of\nwhom 557 (30.4%) were admitted. This gives a sample odds ratio of 1.83,\nindicating that males were almost twice as likely to be admitted. In\nfact, graphical methods (as in the example below) or log-linear\nmodelling show that the apparent association between admission and sex\nstems from differences in the tendency of males and females to apply to\nthe individual departments (females used to apply *more* to departments\nwith higher rejection rates).\n\nThis data set can also be used for illustrating methods for graphical\ndisplay of categorical data, such as the general-purpose mosaicplot or\nthe fourfoldplot for 2-by-2-by-`k`{.reqn} tables.\n\n### References\n\nBickel, P.

They relied primarily on data extracted from the [Integrated\nPublic Use Microdata Series](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPUMS). This\nfollows the same methodology with two modifications:\n\n1\\. IPUMS provided no data for 1940. Wyatt and Hecker (2006) used\n[Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970,\nBicentennial Edition, part 1 (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the\nCensus,\n1975)](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1975/compendia/hist_stats_colonial-1970.html)\nfor 1910-1940. The current data set uses that source only for 1040.\n\n2\\. The IPUMS numbers showed an extreme jump from 1850 to 1860 followed\nby an even more extreme drop to 1870. The numbers in Sobek (2006) showed\nessentially the same behavior. Specifically, Sobek (2006) estimated the\nnumber of accountants and auditors in the US in those three years as\n700, 1700, and 1200, and the labor force as 5277000, 8160800, and\n12004200. These numbers give accountants and auditors as 0.013, 0.021,\nand 0.010 percent of the labor force, respectively for those three\nyears. These numbers portray an incredible increase in the employment of\naccountants and auditors between 1850 and 1860 followed by a shocking\ndecline the following decade. If, however, we swap the 1700 and 1200\nbetween 1860 and 1870, the percentages become quite stable: 0.013,\n0.015, and 0.014 percent, respectively.\n\nWe use these latter numbers, even though the uncorrected numbers seem\nmore consistent with the numbers obtained from IPUMS.\n\n### References\n\n[Historical Statistics of the United States, Colonial Times to 1970,\nBicentennial Edition, part 1 (U.S. Department of Commerce, Bureau of the\nCensus,\n1975)](https://www.census.gov/library/publications/1975/compendia/hist_stats_colonial-1970.html)\n\nSteven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer,\nJose Pacas, and Matthew Sobek (2018) IPUMS USA: Version 8.0 \\[dataset\\].\nMinneapolis, MN: IPUMS.\n[doi:10.18128/D010.V8.0](https://doi.org/10.18128/D010.V8.0)\n\nMatthew Sobek (2006) Chapter Ba. \\\"Labor Occupations\\\" in Susan B.\nCarter, ed., [Historical Statistics of the United States, Cambridge U.\nPr.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_Statistics_of_the_United_States)\n\nIan D.

The marked feature of this plot is the virtual absence of\nbanking crises during the period of the Bretton Woods agreement, 1944 to\n1971.

This has 52 levels for the 50 states plus the District of\n    Columbia (DC) and Puerto Rico (PR).\n\nBusiness_Associate_Involved\n\n:   Factor giving the name of a subcontractor (or blank) associated with\n    the breach.\n\nIndividuals_Affected\n\n:   `integer` number of humans whose records were compromised in the\n    breach. This is 500 or greater; U.S. law requires reports of\n    breaches involving 500 or more records but not of breaches involving\n    fewer.\n\nDate_of_Breach\n\n:   `character` vector giving the date or date range of the breach.\n    Recodes as `Date`s in `breach_start` and `breach_end`.\n\nType_of_Breach\n\n:   `factor` with 29 levels giving the type of breach (e.g., \\\"Theft\\\"\n    vs. \\\"Unauthorized Access/Disclosure\\\", etc.)\n\nLocation_of_Breached_Information\n\n:   `factor` with 41 levels coding the location from which the breach\n    occurred (e.g., \\\"Paper\\\", \\\"Laptop\\\", etc.)\n\nDate_Posted_or_Updated\n\n:   `Date` the information was posted to the HHS data base or last\n    updated.\n\nSummary\n\n:   `character` vector of a summary of the incident.\n\nbreach_start\n\n:   `Date` of the start of the incident = first date given in\n    `Date_of_Breach` above.\n\n`breach_end` `Date` of the end of the incident or `NA` if only one date\nis given in `Date_of_Breach` above. `year` `integer` giving the year of\nthe breach\n\n### Details\n\nThe data primarily consists of breaches that occurred from 2010 through\nearly 2014 when the extract was taken. However, a few breaches are\nrecorded including 1 from 1997, 8 from 2002-2007, 13 from 2008 and 56\nfrom 2009. The numbers of breaches from 2010 - 2014 are 211, 229, 227,\n254 and 56, respectively. (A chi-square test for equality of the counts\nfrom 2010 through 2013 is 4.11, which with 3 degrees of freedom has a\nsignificance probability of 0.25. Thus, even though the lowest number is\nthe first and the largest count is the last, the apparent trend is not\nstatistically significant under the usual assumption of independent\nPoisson trials.)\n\nThe following corrections were made to the file:\n\n  -------- --------------------------------------- -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    Number Name of Covered Entity                  Corrections\n                                                   \n        45 Wyoming Department of Health            Cause of breach was missing.

Through 2020,\nthis database contains information on 209,706 incidents.\n\n`terrorism` provides a few summary statistics along with an `ordered`\nfactor `methodology`, which [Pape et\nal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/11/how-to-fix-the-flaws-in-the-global-terrorism-database-and-why-it-matters/)\ninsisted is necessary, because an increase of over 70 percent in suicide\nterrorism between 2007 and 2013 is best explained by a methodology\nchange in GTD that occurred on 2011-11-01; Pape\\'s own [Suicide Attack\nDatabase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Attack_Database) showed\na 19 percent *decrease* over the same period.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\n`incidents.byCountryYr` and `nkill.byCountryYr` are matrices giving the\nnumbers of incidents and numbers of deaths by year and by location of\nthe event for 204 countries (rows) and for all years between 1970 and\n2060 (columns) except for 1993, for which the entries are all NA,\nbecause the raw data previously collected was lost (though the total for\nthat year is available in the `data.frame` `terrorism`).\n\nNOTES:\n\n1\\. For `nkill.byCountryYr` and for `terrorism[c('nkill', 'nkill.us')]`,\nNAs in GTD were treated as 0. Thus the actual number of deaths were\nlikely higher, unless this was more than offset by incidents being\nclassified as terrorism, when they should not have been.\n\n2\\. `incidents.byCountryYr` and `nkill.byCountryYr` are NA for 1993,\nbecause the GTD data for that year were lost.\n\n`terrorism` is a `data.frame` containing the following:\n\nyear\n\n:   integer year, 1970:2020.\n\nmethodology\n\n:   an `ordered` factor giving the methodology / organization\n    responsible for the data collection for most of the given year. The\n    Pinkerton Global Intelligence Service (`PGIS`) managed data\n    collection from 1970-01-01 to 1997-12-31. The Center for Terrorism\n    and Intelligence Studies (`CETIS`) managed the project from\n    1998-01-01 to 2008-03-31. The Institute for the Study of Violent\n    Groups (`ISVG`) carried the project from 2008-04-01 to 2011-10-31.\n    The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to\n    Terrorism (`START`) has managed data collection since 2011-11-01.\n    For this variable, partial years are ignored, so `methodology` =\n    `CEDIS` for 1998:2007, `ISVG` for 2008:2011, and `START` for more\n    recent data.\n\nmethod\n\n:   a character vector consisting of the first character of the levels\n    of `methodology`:\n\n    c(\\'p\\', \\'c\\', \\'i\\', \\'s\\')\n\nincidents\n\n:   integer number of incidents identified each year.\n\n    NOTE: `sum(terrorism[[\"incidents\"]])` = 214660 = 209706 in the GTD\n    database plus 4954 for 1993, for which the incident-level data were\n    lost.\n\nincidents.us\n\n:   integer number of incidents identified each year with `country_txt`\n    = \\\"United States\\\".\n\nsuicide\n\n:   integer number of incidents classified as \\\"suicide\\\" by GTD\n    variable `suicide` = 1. For 2007, this is 359, the number reported\n    by [Pape et\n    al.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/11/how-to-fix-the-flaws-in-the-global-terrorism-database-and-why-it-matters/)\n    For 2013, it is 624, which is 5 more than the 619 mentioned by Pape\n    et al. Without checking with the SMART project administrators, one\n    might suspect that 5 more suicide incidents from 2013 were found\n    after the data Pape et al. analyzed but before the data used for\n    this analysis.\n\nsuicide.us\n\n:   Number of suicide incidents by year with `country_txt` = \\\"United\n    States\\\".\n\nnkill\n\n:   number of confirmed fatalities for incidents in the given year,\n    including attackers = `sum(nkill, na.rm=TRUE)` in the GTD incident\n    data.\n\n    NOTE: `nkill` in the GTD incident data includes both perpetrators\n    and victims when both are available. It includes one when only one\n    is available and is `NA` when neither is available. However, in most\n    cases, we might expect that the more spectacular and lethal\n    incidents would likely be more accurately reported. To the extent\n    that this is true, it means that when numbers are missing, they are\n    usually zero or small. This further suggests that the summary\n    numbers recorded here probably represent a slight but not\n    substantive undercount.\n\nnkill.us\n\n:   number of U.S. citizens who died as a result of incidents for that\n    year = `sum(nkill.us, na.rm=TRUE)` in the GTD incident data.\n\n    NOTES:\n\n    1\\. This is subject to the same likely modest undercount discussed\n    with `nkill`.)\n\n    2\\. These are U.S. citizens killed regardless of location. This\n    explains at least part of the discrepancies between\n    `terrorism[, 'nkill.us']` and\n    `nkill.byCountryYr['United States', ]`.\n\nnwound\n\n:   number of people wounded. (This is subject to the same likely modest\n    undercount discussed with `nkill`.)\n\nnwound.us\n\n:   Number of U.S. citizens wounded in terrorist incidents for that year\n    = `sum(nwound.us, na.rm=TRUE)` in the GTD incident data. (This is\n    subject to the same likely modest undercount discussed with\n    `nkill`.)\n\npNA.nkill, pNA.nkill.us, pNA.nwound, pNA.nwound.us\n\n:   proportion of observations by year with missing values. These\n    numbers are higher for the early data than more recent numbers. This\n    is particularly true for `nkill.us` and `nwound.us`, which exceed 90\n    percent for most of the period with `methodology` = `PGIS`, prior to\n    1998.\n\nworldPopulation, USpopulation\n\n:   Estimated de facto population in thousands living in the world and\n    in the US as of 1 July of the year indicated, according to the\n    Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs\n    of the United Nations; see \\\"Sources\\\" below.\n\nworldDeathRate, USdeathRate\n\n:   [Crude death rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate)\n    (deaths per 1,000 population) worldwide and in the US, according to\n    the World Bank; see \\\"Sources\\\" below. This World Bank data set\n    includes `USdeathRate` for each year from 1900 to 2020.\n\n    NOTE: `USdeathRate` to 2009 is to two significant digits only. Other\n    death rates carry more significant digits.\n\nworldDeaths, USdeaths\n\n:   number of deaths by year in the world and US\n\n    `worldDeaths = worldPopulation * worldDeathRate`.\n\n    `USdeaths` were computed by summing across age groups in\n    \\\"Deaths_5x1.txt\\\" for the United States, downloaded from\n    <https://www.mortality.org/Country/Country?cntr=USA> from the Human\n    Mortality Database; see sources below.\n\nkill.pmp, kill.pmp.us\n\n:   terrorism deaths per million population worldwide and in the US =\n\n    `nkill / (0.001*worldPopulation)`\n\n    `nkill.us / (0.001*USpopulation)`\n\npkill, pkill.us\n\n:   terrorism deaths as a proportion of total deaths worldwide and in\n    the US\n\n    `pkill = nkill / worldDeaths`\n\n    `pkill.us = nkill.us / USdeaths`\n\n### Details\n\nAs noted with the \\\"description\\\" above, [Pape et\nal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/11/how-to-fix-the-flaws-in-the-global-terrorism-database-and-why-it-matters/)\nnoted that the GTD reported an increase in suicide terrorism of over 70\npercent between 2007 and 2013, while their [Suicide Attack\nDatabase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Attack_Database) showed\na 19 percent *decrease* over the same period.

(defn Ecdat-incomeInequality "  ------------------ -----------------\n  incomeInequality     Documentation\n  ------------------ -----------------\n\n## Income Inequality in the US\n\n### Description\n\nData on quantiles of the distributions of family incomes in the United\nStates. This combines three data sources:\n\n\\(1\\) US Census Table F-1 for the central quantiles\n\n\\(2\\) Piketty and Saez for the 95th and higher quantiles\n\n\\(3\\) Gross Domestic Product and implicit price deflators from Measuring\nWorth. (NOTE: The Measuring Worth Web site,\n`https://MeasuringWorth.com`, often gives security warnings. The desired\ndata still seems to be available and not corrupted, however.)\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA `data.frame` containing:\n\nYear\n\n:   numeric year 1947:2012\n\nNumber.thousands\n\n:   number of families in the US\n\nquintile1, quintile2, median, quintile3, quintile4, p95\n\n:   quintile1, quintile2, quintile3, quintile4, and p95 are the\n    indicated quantiles of the distribution of family income from US\n    Census Table F-1. The media is computed as the geometric mean of\n    quintile2 and quintile3. This is accurate to the extent that the\n    lognormal distribution adequately approximates the central 20\n    percent of the income distribution, which it should for most\n    practical purposes.\n\nP90, P95, P99, P99.5, P99.9, P99.99\n\n:   The indicated quantiles of family income per Piketty and Saez\n\nrealGDP.M, GDP.Deflator, PopulationK, realGDPperCap\n\n:   real GDP in millions, GDP implicit price deflators, US population in\n    thousands, and real GDP per capita, according to\n    `MeasuringWorth.com`. (NOTE: The web address for this,\n    `https://MeasuringWorth.com`, seems to be functional but may not be\n    maintained to current internet security standards. It is therefore\n    given here as text rather than a hot link.)\n\nP95IRSvsCensus\n\n:   ratio of the estimates of the 95th percentile of distributions of\n    family income from the Piketty and Saez analysis of data from the\n    Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and from the US Census Bureau.\n\n    The IRS has ranged between 72 and 98 percent of the Census Bureau\n    figures for the 95th percentile of the distribution, with this ratio\n    averaging around 75 percent since the late 1980s. However, this\n    systematic bias is modest relative to the differences between the\n    different quantiles of interest in this combined dataset.\n\npersonsPerFamily\n\n:   average number of persons per family using the number of families\n    from US Census Table F-1 and the population from MeasuringWorth.\n    (Note: The web site for Measuring Worth,\n    `https://MeasuringWorth.com`, often gives security warnings. It\n    still seems to work. It seems that the web site is not maintained to\n    current internet security standards.)\n\nrealGDPperFamily\n\n:   `personsPerFamily * realGDPperCap`\n\nmean.median\n\n:   ratio of `realGDPperFamily` to the median. This is a measure of\n    skewness and income inequality.\n\n### Details\n\nFor details on how this `data.frame` was created, see\n`\"F1.PikettySaez.R\"` in `system.file('scripts', package='fda')`. This\nprovides links for files to download and R commands to read those files\nand convert them into an updated version of `incomeInequality`. This is\na reasonable thing to do if it is more than 2 years since\n`max(incomeInequality$year)`. All data are in constant 2012 dollars.\n\n### Author(s)\n\nSpencer Graves\n\n### Source\n\nUnited States Census Bureau, Table F-1.

Through 2020,\nthis database contains information on 209,706 incidents.\n\n`terrorism` provides a few summary statistics along with an `ordered`\nfactor `methodology`, which [Pape et\nal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/11/how-to-fix-the-flaws-in-the-global-terrorism-database-and-why-it-matters/)\ninsisted is necessary, because an increase of over 70 percent in suicide\nterrorism between 2007 and 2013 is best explained by a methodology\nchange in GTD that occurred on 2011-11-01; Pape\\'s own [Suicide Attack\nDatabase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Attack_Database) showed\na 19 percent *decrease* over the same period.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\n`incidents.byCountryYr` and `nkill.byCountryYr` are matrices giving the\nnumbers of incidents and numbers of deaths by year and by location of\nthe event for 204 countries (rows) and for all years between 1970 and\n2060 (columns) except for 1993, for which the entries are all NA,\nbecause the raw data previously collected was lost (though the total for\nthat year is available in the `data.frame` `terrorism`).\n\nNOTES:\n\n1\\. For `nkill.byCountryYr` and for `terrorism[c('nkill', 'nkill.us')]`,\nNAs in GTD were treated as 0. Thus the actual number of deaths were\nlikely higher, unless this was more than offset by incidents being\nclassified as terrorism, when they should not have been.\n\n2\\. `incidents.byCountryYr` and `nkill.byCountryYr` are NA for 1993,\nbecause the GTD data for that year were lost.\n\n`terrorism` is a `data.frame` containing the following:\n\nyear\n\n:   integer year, 1970:2020.\n\nmethodology\n\n:   an `ordered` factor giving the methodology / organization\n    responsible for the data collection for most of the given year. The\n    Pinkerton Global Intelligence Service (`PGIS`) managed data\n    collection from 1970-01-01 to 1997-12-31. The Center for Terrorism\n    and Intelligence Studies (`CETIS`) managed the project from\n    1998-01-01 to 2008-03-31. The Institute for the Study of Violent\n    Groups (`ISVG`) carried the project from 2008-04-01 to 2011-10-31.\n    The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to\n    Terrorism (`START`) has managed data collection since 2011-11-01.\n    For this variable, partial years are ignored, so `methodology` =\n    `CEDIS` for 1998:2007, `ISVG` for 2008:2011, and `START` for more\n    recent data.\n\nmethod\n\n:   a character vector consisting of the first character of the levels\n    of `methodology`:\n\n    c(\\'p\\', \\'c\\', \\'i\\', \\'s\\')\n\nincidents\n\n:   integer number of incidents identified each year.\n\n    NOTE: `sum(terrorism[[\"incidents\"]])` = 214660 = 209706 in the GTD\n    database plus 4954 for 1993, for which the incident-level data were\n    lost.\n\nincidents.us\n\n:   integer number of incidents identified each year with `country_txt`\n    = \\\"United States\\\".\n\nsuicide\n\n:   integer number of incidents classified as \\\"suicide\\\" by GTD\n    variable `suicide` = 1. For 2007, this is 359, the number reported\n    by [Pape et\n    al.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/11/how-to-fix-the-flaws-in-the-global-terrorism-database-and-why-it-matters/)\n    For 2013, it is 624, which is 5 more than the 619 mentioned by Pape\n    et al. Without checking with the SMART project administrators, one\n    might suspect that 5 more suicide incidents from 2013 were found\n    after the data Pape et al. analyzed but before the data used for\n    this analysis.\n\nsuicide.us\n\n:   Number of suicide incidents by year with `country_txt` = \\\"United\n    States\\\".\n\nnkill\n\n:   number of confirmed fatalities for incidents in the given year,\n    including attackers = `sum(nkill, na.rm=TRUE)` in the GTD incident\n    data.\n\n    NOTE: `nkill` in the GTD incident data includes both perpetrators\n    and victims when both are available. It includes one when only one\n    is available and is `NA` when neither is available. However, in most\n    cases, we might expect that the more spectacular and lethal\n    incidents would likely be more accurately reported. To the extent\n    that this is true, it means that when numbers are missing, they are\n    usually zero or small. This further suggests that the summary\n    numbers recorded here probably represent a slight but not\n    substantive undercount.\n\nnkill.us\n\n:   number of U.S. citizens who died as a result of incidents for that\n    year = `sum(nkill.us, na.rm=TRUE)` in the GTD incident data.\n\n    NOTES:\n\n    1\\. This is subject to the same likely modest undercount discussed\n    with `nkill`.)\n\n    2\\. These are U.S. citizens killed regardless of location. This\n    explains at least part of the discrepancies between\n    `terrorism[, 'nkill.us']` and\n    `nkill.byCountryYr['United States', ]`.\n\nnwound\n\n:   number of people wounded. (This is subject to the same likely modest\n    undercount discussed with `nkill`.)\n\nnwound.us\n\n:   Number of U.S. citizens wounded in terrorist incidents for that year\n    = `sum(nwound.us, na.rm=TRUE)` in the GTD incident data. (This is\n    subject to the same likely modest undercount discussed with\n    `nkill`.)\n\npNA.nkill, pNA.nkill.us, pNA.nwound, pNA.nwound.us\n\n:   proportion of observations by year with missing values. These\n    numbers are higher for the early data than more recent numbers. This\n    is particularly true for `nkill.us` and `nwound.us`, which exceed 90\n    percent for most of the period with `methodology` = `PGIS`, prior to\n    1998.\n\nworldPopulation, USpopulation\n\n:   Estimated de facto population in thousands living in the world and\n    in the US as of 1 July of the year indicated, according to the\n    Population Division of the Department of Economic and Social Affairs\n    of the United Nations; see \\\"Sources\\\" below.\n\nworldDeathRate, USdeathRate\n\n:   [Crude death rate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mortality_rate)\n    (deaths per 1,000 population) worldwide and in the US, according to\n    the World Bank; see \\\"Sources\\\" below. This World Bank data set\n    includes `USdeathRate` for each year from 1900 to 2020.\n\n    NOTE: `USdeathRate` to 2009 is to two significant digits only. Other\n    death rates carry more significant digits.\n\nworldDeaths, USdeaths\n\n:   number of deaths by year in the world and US\n\n    `worldDeaths = worldPopulation * worldDeathRate`.\n\n    `USdeaths` were computed by summing across age groups in\n    \\\"Deaths_5x1.txt\\\" for the United States, downloaded from\n    <https://www.mortality.org/Country/Country?cntr=USA> from the Human\n    Mortality Database; see sources below.\n\nkill.pmp, kill.pmp.us\n\n:   terrorism deaths per million population worldwide and in the US =\n\n    `nkill / (0.001*worldPopulation)`\n\n    `nkill.us / (0.001*USpopulation)`\n\npkill, pkill.us\n\n:   terrorism deaths as a proportion of total deaths worldwide and in\n    the US\n\n    `pkill = nkill / worldDeaths`\n\n    `pkill.us = nkill.us / USdeaths`\n\n### Details\n\nAs noted with the \\\"description\\\" above, [Pape et\nal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/11/how-to-fix-the-flaws-in-the-global-terrorism-database-and-why-it-matters/)\nnoted that the GTD reported an increase in suicide terrorism of over 70\npercent between 2007 and 2013, while their [Suicide Attack\nDatabase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Attack_Database) showed\na 19 percent *decrease* over the same period. Pape et al. insisted that\nthe most likely explanation for this difference is the change in the\norganization responsible for managing that data collection from `ISVG`\nto `START`.\n\nIf the issue is restricted to how incidents are classified as \\\"suicide\nterrorism\\\", this concern does not affect the other variables in this\nsummary.\n\nHowever, if it also impacts what incidents are classified as\n\\\"terrorism\\\", it suggests larger problems.\n\n### Author(s)\n\nSpencer Graves\n\n### Source\n\nNational Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to\nTerrorism (START).

That\\'s not true for the date upon which each country\nstarted its nuclear program, coded in `startNucPgm` and `startNucPgmYr`.\nThe following summarizes the rationale behind the selection of the date\nfor each country in this dataset.\n\n-   `US` The [Manhattan\n    Project](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manhattan_Project) started in\n    stages. It was officially brought to the attention of the US\n    government by a letter officially from [Albert Einstein to US\n    President\n    Roosevelt](https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Einstein-Roosevelt-letter.png),\n    1939-08-02. It was officially authorized\n    [1942-01-19](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timeline_of_the_Manhattan_Project).\n    We use this later date as the date of the start of the US\n    nuclear-weapons program.\n\n-   `RU` Russian scientists were studying uranium before the first world\n    war but didn\\'t get much official attention until the atomic bombing\n    of Hiroshima, 1945-08-06. Shortly thereafter on\n    [1945-08-22](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soviet_atomic_bomb_project),\n    Stalin appointed [Lavrentiy\n    Beria](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lavrentiy_Beria). Beria was a\n    able administrator and guided the project to fruition in four years.\n\n-   `GB` British scientists were among the leaders in nuclear technology\n    in the late nineteenth century. They welcomed German-Jewish\n    physicists [Otto\n    Frisch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Robert_Frisch) and\n    [Rudolf Peierls](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rudolf_Peierls), who\n    estimated in 1939 that only [a few pounds or kilograms of\n    uranium-235 might be enough to achieve a critical mass, whereas\n    several tonnes of natural uranium would likely be\n    required](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frisch-Peierls_memorandum).\n    Because of the war, this information was passed to scientists in the\n    United States, who developed it into the bomb dropped on Hiroshima\n    [1945-08-06](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki),\n    with help from British and Canadian scientists and Canadian\n    industry. After the war, the US refused to share much of the\n    information developed in the Manhattan Project with the British.\n    British elites felt disrespected by US. On\n    [1947-01-08](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_weapons_and_the_United_Kingdom#Resumption_of_independent_UK_efforts),\n    the British government decided to initiate their own nuclear-weapons\n    program.\n\n-   `FR` France was one of the nuclear pioneers, going back to the work\n    of [Marie Curie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie_Curie) and\n    [Henri Becquerel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Becquerel) in\n    the 1890s. In 1956 the French were deeply offended by the refusal of\n    the US to support them in the [Suez\n    Crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suez_Crisis). On [France and\n    Israel secretly agreed to collaborate in the development of nuclear\n    weapons](https://nuke.fas.org/guide/israel/nuke/farr.htm).\n\n-   `CN` [Mao Zedong reportedly decided to begin a Chinese\n    nuclear-weapons\n    program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China_and_weapons_of_mass_destruction#History)\n    during the [First Taiwan Strait Crisis of\n    1954--1955](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis#Aftermath:_China_and_nuclear_weapons).\n    That crisis was resolved shortly after\n    [1955-04-23](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Taiwan_Strait_Crisis#Aftermath:_China_and_nuclear_weapons),\n    when China stated it was willing to negotiate. We use this as the\n    date of the start of China\\'s nuclear weapons program.\n\n-   `IN` Indian scientists started research on nuclear weapons before\n    Indian independence but didn\\'t make a substantive commitment to\n    actually making a nuclear weapon until they lost territory to China\n    in the [Sino-Indian\n    War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sino-Indian_War) that ended\n    1962-11-21. We use that date as the date for the initiation of\n    India\\'s nuclear-weapons program.\n\n-   `IL` Israel\\'s first Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion was reportedly\n    \\\"nearly obsessed\\\" with obtaining nuclear weapons to prevent the\n    Holocaust from recurring. For present purposes, we use 1949-03-10,\n    the date of the end of the [1948 Arab--Israeli\n    War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1948_Arab-Israeli_War), as the\n    beginning of Israel\\'s nuclear-weapons program.\n\n-   `PK` Pakistan\\'s elite were totally humiliated by their defeat in\n    the [Indo-Pakistani War of\n    1971](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indo-Pakistani_War_of_1971),\n    1971-12-03 / -16: That war ended the [Bangladesh Liberation\n    War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Liberation_War), by\n    which Pakistan lost over half their population and 14 percent of\n    their land area. Prime Minister Zulfiqar Ali Bhutto compared\n    Pakistan\\'s surrender to the Treaty of Versailles, which Germany was\n    forced to sign in 1919. Bhutto observed 1972-01-20 that a Pakistani\n    scientist had been part of the Manhattan Project, and Pakistani\n    scientists could do the same in Pakistan. While significant funding\n    seemed not to have come until later, 1972-01-20 is the date we will\n    use here for the beginning of Pakistan\\'s nuclear-weapons program.\n\n-   `KP` The 1950-1953 Korean War ended with a cease-fire, not an\n    official end to hostilities. Since then North Korea has perceived\n    nuclear threats from the US. In 1956 the Soviet Union began giving\n    North Korean scientists and engineers \\\"basic knowledge\\\" to help\n    them initiate a nuclear program. About 1962, [North Korea committed\n    itself to what it called\n    \\\"all-fortressization\\\"](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2016/02/18/these-5-things-help-make-sense-of-north-koreas-nuclear-tests-and-missile-launch/),\n    which was the beginning of the hyper-militarized North Korea of\n    today. North Korea reportedly asked the Soviet Union for help with a\n    nuclear weapons program in 1963 and was turned down. China turned\n    down similar requests in 1964 and 1974. Around 1980 North Korea\n    began mining its own supplies of uranium and building its own\n    factory to produce\n    [yellowcake](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yellowcake). (See also\n    Bolton, 2012.) For lack of something better, we use 1980-01-01 as\n    the start of North Korea\\'s nuclear weapons program. They clearly\n    wanted nuclear weapons much earlier but didn\\'t seem to move\n    seriously in the direction of developing nuclear weapons until\n    around\n\n### Source\n\nOverview from [World Nuclear Weapon\nStockpile](https://www.ploughshares.org/world-nuclear-stockpile-report)\n\n`firstTest` from [Wikipedia, \\\"List of states with nuclear\nweapons\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_states_with_nuclear_weapons)\n\nUS from Hans M.

(defn Ecdat-OCC1950 "  --------- -----------------\n  OCC1950     Documentation\n  --------- -----------------\n\n## Evolution of occupational distribution in the US\n\n### Description\n\nProportion of the US population in each of the 283 `OCC1950` occupation\ncodes for each year in the [Integrated Public Use Microdata Series\n(IPUMS) - US database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPUMS).\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA `matrix` with one row for each of 281 OCC1950 occupation codes in\nIPUMS-US and one column for each year in their dataset as of 2020-03-17,\nbeing `c(1850:1880, 1900:2000, 2001:2016)`.\n\n### Details\n\nThis dataset was created using the code in the IPUMS vignette in the\n`Ecfun` package using\n`tapply(HHWT, IPUMSdata[c(\"OCC1950\", \"YEAR\")], sum)`, then normalizing\nso the total for each year was 1.\n\nIn fact a plot of the sums for each year of `HHWT` were close to the\n`USGDPpresidents$population.K*1000` except for 1970, when they were\ndouble.\n\nUniverse Note from the IPUMS documentation for their variable `OCC1950`:\n\\\"New Workers\\\" are persons seeking employment for the first time, who\nhad not yet secured their first job.\n\nOCC1950 applies the 1950 Census Bureau occupational classification\nsystem to occupational data, to enhance comparability across years. For\npre-1940 samples created at the University of Minnesota, the alphabetic\nresponses supplied by enumerators were directly coded into the 1950\nclassification. For other samples, the information in the variable OCC\nwas recoded into the 1950 classification. Codes above 970 are\nnon-occupational responses retained in the historical census samples or\nblank/unknown. The design of OCC1950 is described at length in\n\\\"Integrated Occupation and Industry Codes and Occupational Standing\nVariables in the IPUMS.\\\". The composition of the 1950 occupation\ncategories is described in detail in U.S. Bureau of the Census,\nAlphabetic Index of Occupations and Industries: 1950 (Washington D.C.,\n1950).\n\nIn 1850-1880, any laborer with no specified industry in a household with\na farmer is recoded into farm labor. In 1860-1900, any woman with an\noccupational response of \\\"housekeeper\\\" enters the non-occupational\ncategory \\\"keeping house\\\" if she is related to the head of household.\nCases affected by these imputation procedures are identified by an\nappropriate data quality flag (present in the raw IPUMS data but ignored\nfor this summary).\n\nA parallel variable called OCC1990, available for the samples from 1950\nonward, codes occupations into a simplified version of the 1990\noccupational coding scheme.\\\" \\[OCC1990 was ignored for the present\npurposes, because it is not coded for data prior to 1950.\\]\n\nNOTE: In the 2020-03-17 extraction, there were 283 OCC1950 codes\ndocumented, but only 291 of them were actually in the data I got. The\ncodes for \\\"Not yet classified\\\" and \\\"New Workers\\\" were not used.\n\n### Source\n\nSteven Ruggles, Sarah Flood, Ronald Goeken, Josiah Grover, Erin Meyer,\nJose Pacas, and Matthew Sobek (2020)\n[doi:10.18128/D010.V10.0](https://doi.org/10.18128/D010.V10.0)IPUMS USA:\nVersion 10.0 \\[dataset\\].

(defn Ecdat-terrorism "::: container\n  ----------- -----------------\n  terrorism     Documentation\n  ----------- -----------------\n\n## Global Terrorism Database yearly summaries {#terrorism}\n\n### Description\n\nThe [Global Terrorism Database\n(GTD)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Terrorism_Database) \\\"is a\ndatabase of incidents of terrorism from 1970 onward\\\". Through 2020,\nthis database contains information on 209,706 incidents.\n\n`terrorism` provides a few summary statistics along with an `ordered`\nfactor `methodology`, which [Pape et\nal.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/11/how-to-fix-the-flaws-in-the-global-terrorism-database-and-why-it-matters/)\ninsisted is necessary, because an increase of over 70 percent in suicide\nterrorism between 2007 and 2013 is best explained by a methodology\nchange in GTD that occurred on 2011-11-01; Pape\\'s own [Suicide Attack\nDatabase](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suicide_Attack_Database) showed\na 19 percent *decrease* over the same period.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\n`incidents.byCountryYr` and `nkill.byCountryYr` are matrices giving the\nnumbers of incidents and numbers of deaths by year and by location of\nthe event for 204 countries (rows) and for all years between 1970 and\n2060 (columns) except for 1993, for which the entries are all NA,\nbecause the raw data previously collected was lost (though the total for\nthat year is available in the `data.frame` `terrorism`).\n\nNOTES:\n\n1\\. For `nkill.byCountryYr` and for `terrorism[c('nkill', 'nkill.us')]`,\nNAs in GTD were treated as 0. Thus the actual number of deaths were\nlikely higher, unless this was more than offset by incidents being\nclassified as terrorism, when they should not have been.\n\n2\\. `incidents.byCountryYr` and `nkill.byCountryYr` are NA for 1993,\nbecause the GTD data for that year were lost.\n\n`terrorism` is a `data.frame` containing the following:\n\nyear\n\n:   integer year, 1970:2020.\n\nmethodology\n\n:   an `ordered` factor giving the methodology / organization\n    responsible for the data collection for most of the given year. The\n    Pinkerton Global Intelligence Service (`PGIS`) managed data\n    collection from 1970-01-01 to 1997-12-31. The Center for Terrorism\n    and Intelligence Studies (`CETIS`) managed the project from\n    1998-01-01 to 2008-03-31. The Institute for the Study of Violent\n    Groups (`ISVG`) carried the project from 2008-04-01 to 2011-10-31.\n    The National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to\n    Terrorism (`START`) has managed data collection since 2011-11-01.\n    For this variable, partial years are ignored, so `methodology` =\n    `CEDIS` for 1998:2007, `ISVG` for 2008:2011, and `START` for more\n    recent data.\n\nmethod\n\n:   a character vector consisting of the first character of the levels\n    of `methodology`:\n\n    c(\\'p\\', \\'c\\', \\'i\\', \\'s\\')\n\nincidents\n\n:   integer number of incidents identified each year.\n\n    NOTE: `sum(terrorism[[\"incidents\"]])` = 214660 = 209706 in the GTD\n    database plus 4954 for 1993, for which the incident-level data were\n    lost.\n\nincidents.us\n\n:   integer number of incidents identified each year with `country_txt`\n    = \\\"United States\\\".\n\nsuicide\n\n:   integer number of incidents classified as \\\"suicide\\\" by GTD\n    variable `suicide` = 1. For 2007, this is 359, the number reported\n    by [Pape et\n    al.](https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/monkey-cage/wp/2014/08/11/how-to-fix-the-flaws-in-the-global-terrorism-database-and-why-it-matters/)\n    For 2013, it is 624, which is 5 more than the 619 mentioned by Pape\n    et al. Without checking with the SMART project administrators, one\n    might suspect that 5 more suicide incidents from 2013 were found\n    after the data Pape et al. analyzed but before the data used for\n    this analysis.\n\nsuicide.us\n\n:   Number of suicide incidents by year with `country_txt` = \\\"United\n    States\\\".\n\nnkill\n\n:   number of confirmed fatalities for incidents in the given year,\n    including attackers = `sum(nkill, na.rm=TRUE)` in the GTD incident\n    data.\n\n    NOTE: `nkill` in the GTD incident data includes both perpetrators\n    and victims when both are available. It includes one when only one\n    is available and is `NA` when neither is available. However, in most\n    cases, we might expect that the more spectacular and lethal\n    incidents would likely be more accurately reported. To the extent\n    that this is true, it means that when numbers are missing, they are\n    usually zero or small. This further suggests that the summary\n    numbers recorded here probably represent a slight but not\n    substantive undercount.\n\nnkill.us\n\n:   number of U.S. citizens who died as a result of incidents for that\n    year = `sum(nkill.us, na.rm=TRUE)` in the GTD incident data.\n\n    NOTES:\n\n    1\\. This is subject to the same likely modest undercount discussed\n    with `nkill`.)\n\n    2\\. These are U.S. citizens killed regardless of location. This\n    explains at least part of the discrepancies between\n    `terrorism[, 'nkill.us']` and\n    `nkill.byCountryYr['United States', ]`.\n\nnwound\n\n:   number of people wounded. (This is subject to the same likely modest\n    undercount discussed with `nkill`.)\n\nnwound.us\n\n:   Number of U.S. citizens wounded in terrorist incidents for that year\n    = `sum(nwound.us, na.rm=TRUE)` in the GTD incident data. (This is\n    subject to the same likely modest undercount discussed with\n    `nkill`.)\n\npNA.nkill, pNA.nkill.us, pNA.nwound, pNA.nwound.us\n\n:   proportion of observations by year with missing values. These\n    numbers are higher for the early data than more recent numbers.

(defn Ecdat-USGDPpresidents "  ----------------- -----------------\n  USGDPpresidents     Documentation\n  ----------------- -----------------\n\n## US GDP per capita with presidents and wars\n\n### Description\n\nIt is commonly claimed that Franklin Roosevelt (FDR) did not end the\nGreat Depression: World War II (WW2) did. This is supported by the 10.6\npercent growth per year in real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita\nseen in the standard GDP estimates from 1940 to 1945. It is also\nsupported by the rapid decline in unemployment during the war.\n\nHowever, no comparable growth spurts in GDP per capita catch the eye in\na plot of `log(GDP per capita)` from 1790 to 2015, whether associated\nwith a war or not, using data from Measuring Worth. The only other\nfeatures of that plot that seem visually comparable are the economic\ndisaster of Herbert Hoover\\'s presidency (when GDP per capital fell by\n10 percent per year, 1929-1932), the impressive growth of the US economy\nduring the first seven years of Franklin Roosevelt\\'s presidency (6.4\npercent per year, 1933-1940), and the post-World War II recession (when\nGDP per capita fell by 7.9 percent per year, 1945-1947). (NOTE: The web\nsite for Measuring Worth, `https://measuringworth.com/` still works, but\nhas not always been maintained to current internet security standards.\nTherefore, the link is provided here in text but not as a link.)\n\nCloser inspection of this plot suggests that the US economy has\ngenerally grown faster after FDR than before. This might plausibly be\nattributed to [\\\"The Keynesian Ascendancy\n1939-1979\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes).\n\nUnemployment dropped during the First World War as it did during WW2.\nComparable unemployment data are not available for the U.S. during other\nmajor wars, most notably the [American Civil\nWar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_War) and the\n[Mexican-American\nWar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mexican-American_War).\n\nThis data set provides a platform for testing the effects of presidency,\nwar, and Keynes. It does this by combining the numbers for US population\nand real GDP per capital dollars from Measuring Worth with the\npresidency and a list of major wars and an estimate of the battle deaths\nby year per million population. (As noted above, the web address for\nmeasuring worth, `https://measuringworth.com/`, often gives security\nwarnings but still seems to provide the data as before.)\n\n[US unemployment is also\nconsidered.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unemployment_in_the_United_States#Historical_unemployment_rate_charts)\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA `data.frame` containing 259 observations on the following variables:\n\nYear\n\n:   integer: the year, `c(seq(1610, 1770, 10), 1774:2015)`\n\nCPI\n\n:   Numeric: U.

Two nineteenth century presidents are not listed here\n    (William Henry Harrison and James A. Garfield), because they died so\n    soon after inauguration that any contribution they made to the\n    economic growth of the nation might seem too slight to measure\n    accurately in annual data like this; their contributions therefore\n    appear combined with their replacements (John Tyler and Chester A.\n    Arthur, respectively). The service of two other presidents is\n    officially combined here: \\\"Taylor-Fillmore\\\" refers to the 16\n    months served by Zachary Taylor with the 32 months of Millard\n    Fillmore. These modifications make [Barack\n    Obama](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Barack_Obama) number 41 on this\n    list, even though he\\'s the 44th president of the U.S.\n\nwar\n\n:   `ordered`: This lists the major wars in US history by years\n    involving active hostilities. A war is \\\"major\\\" for present\n    purposes if it met two criteria:\n\n    \\(1\\) It averaged at least 10 battle deaths per year per million US\n    population.\n\n    \\(2\\) It was listed in one of two lists of wars: For wars since\n    1816, it must have appeared in the [Correlates of\n    War](https://correlatesofwar.org/). For wars between 1790 and 1815,\n    it must have appeared in the Wikipedia [\\\"List of wars involving the\n    United\n    States\\\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_wars_involving_the_United_States).\n\n    The resulting list includes a few adjustments to the list of wars\n    that might come readily to mind for people moderately familiar with\n    US history.\n\n    A traditional list might start with the American Revolution, the War\n    of 1812, the Mexican-American war, the Civil War, the\n    Spanish-American war, World Wars I and II, Korea, and Vietnam. In\n    addition, the [Northwest Indian\n    War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Northwest_Indian_War) involved\n    very roughly 30 battle deaths per year per million population\n    1785-1795. This compares with the roughly 100 battle deaths per year\n    1812-1815 for the [War of\n    1812](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_of_1812).\n\n    For present purposes, the Spanish-American War is combined with the\n    lesser-known American-Philippine War: The latter involved 50 percent\n    more battle deaths but over a longer period of time and arguably\n    with less impact on the stature of the US as a growing world power.\n    However, its magnitude suggest it might have impacted the US economy\n    in a way roughly comparable to the Spanish-American war. The two are\n    therefore listed here together as \\\"Spanish-American-Philippine\\\"\n    war.\n\n    [The Correlates of War (COW)](https://correlatesofwar.org/) data\n    include multiple US uses of military force during the Vietnam War\n    era. It starts with \\\"Vietnam Phase 1\\\", 1961-65, with 506 battle\n    deaths in the COW data base. It includes the \\\"Second Laotian\\\" war\n    phases 1 and 2, plus engagement with a \\\"Communist Coalition\\\" and\n    Khmer Rouge as well as actions in the Dominican Republic and\n    Guatemala. The current `data.frame` includes only \\\"Vietnam\\\",\n    referring primarily to COW\\'s \\\"Vietnam War, Phase 2\\\", 1965-1973.\n    The associated battle deaths include battle deaths from these other,\n    lesser concurrent conflicts.\n\n    The COW data currently ends in 2007. However, the post-2000\n    conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq averaged less than 1,000 battle\n    deaths per year or roughly 3 battle deaths per year per million\n    population. This is below the threshold of 10 battle deaths per year\n    per million population. This in turn suggests that any impact of\n    those conflicts on the US economy might be small and difficult to\n    estimate.\n\nbattleDeaths\n\n:   numeric: Numbers of battle deaths by year estimated by allocating to\n    the different years the totals reported for each major war in\n    proportion to the number of days officially in conflict each year.\n    The totals were obtained (in August-September 2015) from [The\n    Correlates of War](https://correlatesofwar.org/) data for conflicts\n    since 1816 and from Wikipedia for previous wars back to 1774, as\n    noted above.\n\nbattleDeathsPMP\n\n:   numeric: battle deaths per million population =\n    `1000*battleDeaths/population.K`.\n\nKeynes\n\n:   integer taking the value 1 between 1939 and 1979 and 0 otherwise, as\n    suggested by the section entitled \\\"The Keynesian Ascendancy\n    1939-1979\\\" in the Wikipedia article on [John Maynard\n    Keynes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Maynard_Keynes).\n\nunemployment\n\n:   Estimated US unemployment rate\n\nunempSource\n\n:   `ordered` giving the source for US unemployment:\n\n    1610-1799\n\n    :   `<NA>`\n\n    1800-1889\n\n    :   Lebergott\n\n    1890-1929\n\n    :   Romer\n\n    1930-1939\n\n    :   Coen\n\n    1940-present\n\n    :   BLS\n\n    Clearly, the more recent numbers should be more accurate.\n\nfedReceipts, fedOutlays, fedSurplus\n\n:   Receipts and Outlays of the US federal government in millions of\n    current dollars.\n\n    For data beginning with 1901, these are from the US federal budget\n    from The White House (2022). Earlier data are from series Y 335-337\n    in US Census Bureau (1975). As of 2022-02-22 the data from The White\n    House included aggregations for 1789-1849 and 1850-1900, which\n    matched the totals of Y 335-337 for those two sets of years. The\n    numbers from 1901 to 1933 are the same in both sources.\n\n    We used The White House (2022) for the more recent numbers with one\n    exception: Between 1976 and 1977 the fiscal year was changed from\n    starting July 1 to October 1. July, August, and September, 1976, is\n    called the \\\"transitional quarter\\\", and has been deleted from this\n    dataset.\n\n    NOTES:\n\n    The numbers for 1843 are for only the first half of the year,\n    January 1 through June 30. This explains why the numbers for 1843\n    are only roughly half of the corresponding values for 1844 and 1845.\n\n    Also, the numbers for 1791 are actually for 1789-1791. However,\n    those numbers seem comparable to those for 1792 and 1793, so it is\n    listed as only for one year rather than three.\n\nfedDebt\n\n:   US federal government debt in millions of current dollars per\n    `FiscalData` (2022). This matches Y 338 in United States Census\n    Bureau (1975) 1921-1939 but not earlier, and Y 338 ends with 1939.\n    Between 1921 and 1939 these numbers are as of June 30. Between 1843\n    and 1920 they are as of July 1. The earlier numbers are as of\n    January 1.\n\n    `FiscalData` (2022) includes debt for both January 1 (20 million)\n    and July 1 (33 million) for 1843. For present purposes, we omit the\n    January 1 number. This overstates the volatility of the national\n    debt during that period, showing it rising from 14 million in 1842\n    (January 1) to 33 million in 1843 (July 1), being 18 not 12 months.\n    The alternative would be to delete the 33 million, but that would\n    understate the volatility of the debt during that period.\n\nfedReceipts_pGDP, fedOutlays_pGDP, fedSurplus_pGDP, fedDebt_pGDP\n\n:   numeric = `fedReceipts`, `fedOutlays`, `fedSurplus`, and `fedDebt`\n    divided by `(population.K * realGPDperCapita / (GDPdeflator))`,\n    except for the single year 1843, for which `fedReceipts`,\n    `fedOutlays`, and `fedSurplus` were for only the first six months;\n    to compute `*_pGDP` for these numbers for 1843 only, the denominator\n    in this formula is cut in half to compensate.\n\n### Details\n\n`rownames(USGDPpresidents) = Year`\n\n### Author(s)\n\nSpencer Graves\n\n### Source\n\nRobert M.

And a description was given of how to update that table using\nfiles `p*t03.csv` and `p*t05.csv` from [Prisoners In\n2019](https://bjs.ojp.gov/library/publications/prisoners-2019).\n\nAn initial rationality check was to compute\n\n`checkTot` \\<- `stateFedIncarcerees` - `stateFedMales` -\n`stateFedFemales`\n\nThis was 0 except for 1927 and 1973, when it was 637 and 684. The\n`stateFedFemales` for 1972:1974 was 6269, 6004, 7389. We replaced 6004\nwith 6688, which made the `checkTot` 0 for 1973.\n\nSimilar checks for 1927 yielded nothing as obvious. However, the\n`stateFedIncarcerees` increased 6.9 percent in 1926 over 1925, and 12.2\nand 5.8 percent in the following two years. Subtracting 637 from 109983\nfor 1927 gave us 109346, which reduced the increase to 11.6 percent for\n1927. It\\'s no longer the maximum annual increase prior to 1975.\n\nNext, these numbers were compared with those in `p19t03.csv` and\n`p19t05.csv`, which include numbers of incarcerees and rates per 100,000\npopulation for 2009:2019. The numbers were identical for 2009:2011, but\nthere were several differences for the more recent counts.\n\nFor `USincarcerations`, we used the numbers from `p19t03.csv` and\n`p19t05.csv`, because they seem likely to be more accurate.\n\nHowever, these numbers include only people in state and federal prisons.\nIt excludes jails.\n\n[Key Statistic: Total correctional\npopulation](https://bjs.ojp.gov/data/key-statistics) includes a plot of\n\\\"Total adult correctional population 1980-2016\\\", which does include\njails. The data there are available as\n`Total_correctional_population_counts_by_status.csv`.

For\n2015 only `EntireTaxCodeAndRegs` is given; for other years, this number\nis broken down by income tax vs. other taxes and code vs. regulations.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA `data.frame` containing:\n\nyear\n\n:   tax year\n\nIncomeTaxCode\n\n:   number of words in thousands in the US income tax code\n\notherTaxCode\n\n:   number of words in thousands in US tax code other than income tax\n\nEntireTaxCode\n\n:   number of words in thousands in the US tax code\n\nIncomeTaxRegulations\n\n:   number of words in thousands in US income tax regulations\n\notherTaxRegulations\n\n:   number of words in thousands in US tax regulations other than income\n    tax\n\nIncomeTaxCodeAndRegs\n\n:   number of words in thousands in both the code and regulations for\n    the US income tax\n\notherTaxCodeAndRegs\n\n:   number of words in thousands in both code and regulations for US\n    taxes apart from income taxes.\n\nEntireTaxCodeAndRegs\n\n:   number of words in thousands in US tax code and regulations\n\n### Details\n\nThousands of words in the US tax code and federal tax regulations,\n1955-2015. This is based on data from the Tax Foundation\n(`taxfoundation.org`), adjusted to eliminate an obvious questionable\nobservation in `otherTaxRegulations` for 1965. The numbers of words in\n`otherTaxRegulations` was not reported directly by the Tax Foundation\nbut is easily computed as the difference between their Income and Entire\ntax numbers. This series shows the numbers falling by 48 percent between\n1965 and 1975 and by 1.5 percent between 1995 and 2005. These are the\nonly declines seen in these numbers and seem inconsistent with the\ncommon concern (expressed e.g., in Moody, Warcholik and Hodge, 2005)\nabout the difficulties of simplifying any governmental program, because\nvested interest appear to defend almost anything. Lessig (2011) notes\nthat virtually all provisions of US law that favor certain segments of\nsociety are set to expire after a modest number of years. These sunset\nprovisions provide recurring opportunities for incumbent politicians to\nextort campaign contributions from those same segments to ensure the\ncontinuation of the favorable treatment.\n\nThe decline of 48 percent in `otherTaxRegulations` seems more curious\nfor two additional reasons: First, it was preceded by a tripling of\n`otherTaxRegulations` between 1955 and 1965. Second, it was NOT\naccompanied by any comparable behavior of `otherTaxCode`. Instead, the\nlatter grew each decade by between 17 and 53 percent, similar to but\nslower than the growth in `IncomeTaxCode` and `IncomeTaxRegulations`.\n\nAccordingly, `otherTaxRegulations` for 1965 is replaced by the average\nof the numbers for 1955 and 1975, and `EntireTaxRegulations` for 1965 is\ncomparably adjusted. This replaces (1322, 2960) for those two variables\nfor 1965 with (565, 2203). In addition, `otherTaxCodeAndRegs` and\n`EntireTaxCodeAndRegulations` are also changed from (1626, 3507) to\n(870, 2751).\n\nIndependent of whether this adjustment is correct or not, it\\'s clear\nthat there have been roughly 3 words of regulations for each word in the\ntax code. Most of these are income tax regulations, which have recently\ncontained 4.5 words for every word in code. The income tax code\ncurrently includes roughly 50 percent more words than other tax code.\n\n### Author(s)\n\nSpencer Graves\n\n### Source\n\n[Tax Foundation: Number of Words in Internal Revenue Code and Federal\nTax Regulations,\n1955-2005](https://taxfoundation.org/number-words-internal-revenue-code-and-federal-tax-regulations-1955-2005)\nScott Greenberg, [\\\"Federal Tax Laws and Regulations are Now Over 10\nMillion Words Long\\\", October 08,\n2015](https://taxfoundation.org/federal-tax-laws-and-regulations-are-now-over-10-million-words-long/)\n\n### References\n\nJ.

Each record represents a station, describing which Metro lines are\nserviced by the station, which other connections are available, and\nannual passenger volumes. Basic location information is provided for\neach station in terms of where they reside on a municipal level, and,\nthrough latitude/longitude coordinate values.\n\nThe system has 16 lines (numbered from 1 to 14, with two additional\nlines: 3bis and 7bis) and covers over 200 kilometers of track. The Metro\nruns on standard gauge tracks (1,435 mm) and operates using a variety of\nrolling stock, including rubber-tired trains and steel-wheeled trains\n(which are far more common).\n\nThe Metro is operated by the RATP, which also operates other transit\nsystems in the region, including buses, trams, and the RER. The RER is\nan important component of the region\\'s transit infrastructure, and\nseveral RER stations have connectivity with the Metro. This integration\nallows passengers to transfer between those two systems seamlessly. The\nMetro also has connections to the Transilien rail network, tramway\nstations, several major train stations (e.g., Gare du Nord, Gare de\nl\\'Est, etc.), and many bus lines.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA tibble with 314 rows and 11 variables:\n\nname\n\n:   The name of the station.\n\ncaption\n\n:   In some cases, a station will have a caption that might describe a\n    nearby place of interest.

This is a\n    `character`-based, comma-separated series of line names.\n\nconnect_rer\n\n:   Station connections with the RER. The RER system has five lines (A,\n    B, C, D, and E) with 257 stations and several interchanges with the\n    Metro.\n\nconnect_tram\n\n:   Connections with tramway lines. This system has twelve lines in\n    operation (T1, T2, T3a, T3b, T4, T5, T6, T7, T8, T9, T11, and T13)\n    with 235 stations.\n\nconnect_transilien\n\n:   Connections with Transilien lines. This system has eight lines in\n    operation (H, J, K, L, N, P, R, and U).\n\nconnect_other\n\n:   Other connections with transportation infrastructure such as\n    regional, intercity, night, and high-speed trains (typically at\n    railway stations).\n\nlatitude, longitude\n\n:   The location of the station, given as latitude and longitude values\n    in decimal degrees.\n\nlocation\n\n:   The arrondissement of Paris or municipality in which the station\n    resides. For some stations located at borders, the grouping of\n    locations will be presented as a comma-separated series\n\npassengers\n\n:   The total number of Metro station entries during 2021.

Many volatile organic compounds (VOCs) are\nemitted in substantial quantities from both biogenic and anthropogenic\nsources, and they can have a major influence on the chemistry of the\nlower atmosphere. A portion of these can be transformed into other VOCs\nvia the energy provided from light.\n\nIn order to realistically predict the composition of the atmosphere and\nhow it evolves over time, we need accurate estimates of photolysis\nrates. The data provided here in `photolysis` allows for computations of\nphotolysis rates (*J*, having units of `s^-1`) as a function of the\nsolar zenith angle (SZA).

This set of\nvalues is calculated on the first of every month for 4 different\nnorthern hemisphere latitudes. For determination of afternoon values,\nthe presented tabulated values are symmetric about noon.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA tibble with 816 rows and 4 variables:\n\nlatitude\n\n:   The latitude in decimal degrees for the observations.\n\nmonth\n\n:   The measurement month.

It\\'s defined as the angle of the sun\nrelative to a line perpendicular to the earth\\'s surface. It is useful\nto calculate the SZA in relation to the true solar time. True solar time\nrelates to the position of the sun with respect to the observer, which\nis different depending on the exact longitude. For example, two hours\nbefore the sun crosses the meridian (the highest point it would reach\nthat day) corresponds to a true solar time of 10 a.m. The SZA has a\nstrong dependence on the observer\\'s latitude. For example, at a\nlatitude of 50 degrees N at the start of January, the noontime SZA is\n73.0 but a different observer at 20 degrees N would measure the noontime\nSZA to be 43.0 degrees.\n\n### Examples\n\nHere is a glimpse at the data available in `sza`.\n\n::: {.sourceCode .r}\n    dplyr::glimpse(sza)\n    #> Rows: 816\n    #> Columns: 4\n    #> $ latitude <dbl> 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 20, 2~\n    #> $ month    <fct> jan, jan, jan, jan, jan, jan, jan, jan, jan, jan, jan, jan, j~\n    #> $ tst      <chr> \"0400\", \"0430\", \"0500\", \"0530\", \"0600\", \"0630\", \"0700\", \"0730~\n    #> $ sza      <dbl> NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, NA, 84.9, 78.7, 72.7, 66.1, 61.5, 56.5, 5~\n:::\n\n### Dataset ID and Badge\n\nDATA-2\n\n::: {style=\"text-align:center;\"}\n![This image of that of a dataset\nbadge.](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/gt/master/images/dataset_sza.png){style=\"width:50%;padding-bottom:20px;\"}\n:::\n\n### Dataset Introduced\n\n`v0.2.0.5` (March 31, 2020)\n\n### Source\n\nCalculated Actinic Fluxes (290 - 700 nm) for Air Pollution\nPhotochemistry Applications (Peterson, 1976), available at:\n<https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPURL.cgi?Dockey=9100JA26.txt>.\n\n### See Also\n\nOther datasets: `constants`, `countrypops`, `exibble`, `films`,\n`gibraltar`, `gtcars`, `illness`, `metro`, `nuclides`, `peeps`,\n`photolysis`, `pizzaplace`, `reactions`, `rx_addv`, `rx_adsl`, `sp500`,\n`towny`\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/gt/sza.csv"))

Interest here is on whether the schizophrenia group can be\ndistinguished from the schizoaffective group on these measures.\n\nThe Social Cognitive measures were designed to tap various aspects of\nthe perception and cognitive procession of emotions of others. Emotion\nperception was assessed using a Managing Emotions (`MgeEmotions`) score\nfrom the MCCB. A \\\"theory of mind\\\" (`ToM`) score assessed ability to\nread the emotions of others from photographs of the eye region of male\nand female faces. Two other measures, externalizing bias (`ExtBias`) and\npersonalizing bias (`PersBias`) were calculated from a scale measuring\nthe degree to which individuals attribute internal, personal or\nsituational causal attributions to positive and negative social events.\n\nSee `NeuroCog` for a description of the sample.

He produced a life table showing\nthe number of people surviving to any age from a cohort born the same\nyear. He also used his table to compute the price of life annuities.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA data frame with 84 observations on the following 4 variables.\n\n`age`\n\n:   a numeric vector\n\n`deaths`\n\n:   number of deaths, `D_k`{.reqn}, among people of age k, a numeric\n    vector\n\n`number`\n\n:   size of the population, `P_k`{.reqn} surviving until this age, a\n    numeric vector\n\n`ratio`\n\n:   the ratio `P_{k+1}/P_k`{.reqn}, the conditional probability of\n    surviving until age k + 1 given that one had already reached age k,\n    a numeric vector\n\n### Details\n\nHalley\\'s table contained only `age` and `number`. For people aged over\n84 years, Halley just noted that their total number was 107. This value\nis not included in the data set.\n\nThe data from Breslau had a mean of 1,238 births per year: this is the\nvalue that Halley took for the size, `P_0`{.reqn} of the population\ncohort at age 0. From the data, he could compute the annual mean\n`D_k`{.reqn} of the number of deaths among people aged `k`{.reqn} for\nall `k >= 0`{.reqn}. From this, he calculated the number\n`P_{k+1}`{.reqn} surviving one more year,\n\n`P_{k+1} = P_k - D_k`{.reqn}\n\nThis method had the great advantage of not requiring a general census\nbut only knowledge of the number of births and deaths and of the age at\nwhich people died during a few years.\n\n### Source\n\nN.

R. Macdonell (1902) published an\nextensive paper, *On Criminal Anthropometry and the Identification of\nCriminals* in which he included numerous tables of physical\ncharacteristics 3000 non-habitual male criminals serving their sentences\nin England and Wales. His Table III (p. 216) recorded a bivariate\nfrequency distribution of `height` by `finger` length. His main purpose\nwas to show that Scotland Yard could have indexed their material more\nefficiently, and find a given profile more quickly.\n\nW. S. Gosset (aka \\\"Student\\\") used these data in two classic papers in\n1908, in which he derived various characteristics of the sampling\ndistributions of the mean, standard deviation and Pearson\\'s r. He said,\n\\\"Before I had succeeded in solving my problem analytically, I had\nendeavoured to do so empirically.\\\" Among his experiments, he randomly\nshuffled the 3000 observations from Macdonell\\'s table, and then grouped\nthem into samples of size 4, 8, \\..., calculating the sample means,\nstandard deviations and correlations for each sample.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\n`Macdonell`: A frequency data frame with 924 observations on the\nfollowing 3 variables giving the bivariate frequency distribution of\n`height` and `finger`.\n\n`height`\n\n:   lower class boundaries of height, in decimal ft.\n\n`finger`\n\n:   length of the left middle finger, in mm.\n\n`frequency`\n\n:   frequency of this combination of `height` and `finger`\n\n`MacdonellDF`: A data frame with 3000 observations on the following 2\nvariables.\n\n`height`\n\n:   a numeric vector\n\n`finger`\n\n:   a numeric vector\n\n### Details\n\nClass intervals for `height` in Macdonell\\'s table were given in 1 in.\nranges, from (4\\' 7\\\" 9/16 - 4\\' 8\\\" 9/16), to (6\\' 4\\\" 9/16 - 6\\' 5\\\"\n9/16).

(defn HistData-Mayer "  ------- -----------------\n  Mayer     Documentation\n  ------- -----------------\n\n## Mayer\\'s Data on the Libration of the Moon.\n\n### Description\n\nMayer had twenty-seven days\\' observations of Manilius and only three\nunknowns. The form of Mayer\\'s problem is almost the same as that of\nLegendre, who developed later the least squares method.\n\n\\\"How did Mayer address his overdetermined system of equations? His\napproach was a simple and straightforward one, so simple and\nstraightforward that a twentieth-century reader might arrive at the very\nmistaken opinion that the procedure was not remarkable at all. Mayer\ndivided his equations into three groups of nine equations each, added\neach of the three groups separately, and solved the resulting three\nlinear equations for `\\alpha`{.reqn}, `\\beta`{.reqn} and\n`\\alpha sin\\theta`{.reqn} (and then solved for `\\theta`{.reqn}). His\nchoice of which equations belonged in which groups was based upon the\ncoefficients of `\\alpha`{.reqn} and `\\alpha sin \\theta`{.reqn}. The\nfirst group consisted of the nine equations with the largest positive\nvalues for the coefficient of a, namely, equations 1,2, 3, 6, 9, 10,\n11,12, and 27. The second group were those with the nine largest\nnegative values for this coefficient: equations 8, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23,\n24, 25, and 26. The remaining nine equations formed the third group,\nwhich he described as having the largest values for the coefficient of\n`\\alpha sin \\theta`{.reqn}.\\\"\n\nStigler (1986, p.21)\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA data frame with 27 observations on the following 4 variables.\n\n`Equation`\n\n:   an integer vector, id of the Equation\n\n`Y`\n\n:   a numeric vector, representing the term `(h-90)`{.reqn} (see\n    details)\n\n`X1`\n\n:   a numeric vector, representing `\\beta`{.reqn}\n\n`X2`\n\n:   a numeric vector, representing `\\alpha`{.reqn}\n\n`X3`\n\n:   a numeric vector, representing the term `\\alpha sin\\theta`{.reqn}\n\n`Group`\n\n:   a character vector, representing the Mayer grouping\n\n### Details\n\nStigler (1986):\n\n\\\"The development of the method of least squares was closely associated\nwith three of the major scientific problems of the eighteenth century:\n(1) to determine and represent mathematically the motions of the moon;\n(2) to account for an apparently secular (that is, nonperiodic)\ninequality that had been observed in the motions of the planets Jupiter\nand Saturn; and (3) to determine the shape or figure of the earth. These\nproblems all involved astronomical observations and the theory of\ngravitational attraction, and they all presented intellectual challenges\nthat engaged the attention of many of the ablest mathematical scientists\nof the period.\n\nOver the period from April 1748 to March 1749, Mayer made numerous\nobservations of the positions of several prominent lunar features; and\nin his 1750 memoir he showed how these data could be used to determine\nvarious characteristics of the moon\\'s orbit. His method of handling the\ndata was novel, and it is well worth considering this method in detail,\nboth for the light it sheds on his pioneering, if limited, understanding\nof the problem and because his approach was widely circulated in the\nmajor contemporary treatise on astronomy, having signal influence upon\nlater work.\\\"\n\nHis analysis led to this equation:\n\n`\\beta - (90-h) = \\alpha sin(g-k) - \\alpha sin\\theta cos(g-k)`{.reqn}\n\nAccording to Stigler (1986, p. 21), this \\\"equation would hold if no\nerrors were present. The modern tendency would be to write, say\\\":\n\n`(h - 90) = - \\beta + \\alpha sin (g - k) - \\alpha sin\\theta cos(g - k) + E`{.reqn}\n\ntreating `(h - 90)`{.reqn} as the dependent variable and\n`-\\beta`{.reqn}, `\\alpha`{.reqn}, and `-\\alpha sin \\theta`{.reqn} as the\nparameters in a linear regression model.\n\n### Author(s)\n\nLuiz Fernando Palin Droubi\n\n### Source\n\nStigler, Stephen M.

It\nis adapted from data in the article by Francis et al. (1955). There were\nactually two clinical trials, corresponding to two statistical designs\n(`Experiment`), discussed by Brownlee (1955). The comparison of designs\nand results represented a milestone in the development of randomized\nclinical trials.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA data frame with 8 observations on the following 6 variables.\n\n`Experiment`\n\n:   a factor with levels `ObservedControl` `RandomizedControl`\n\n`Group`\n\n:   a factor with levels `Controls` `Grade2NotInoculated`\n    `IncompleteVaccinations` `NotInoculated` `Placebo` `Vaccinated`\n\n`Population`\n\n:   the size of the population in each group in each experiment\n\n`Paralytic`\n\n:   the number of cases of paralytic polio observed in that group\n\n`NonParalytic`\n\n:   the number of cases of paralytic polio observed in that group\n\n`FalseReports`\n\n:   the number of cases initially reported as polio, but later\n    determined not to be polio in that group\n\n### Details\n\nThe data frame is in the form of a single table, but actually comprises\nthe results of two separate field trials, given by `Experiment`. Each\nshould be analyzed separately, because the designs differ markedly.\n\nThe original design (`Experiment == \"ObservedControl\"`) called for\nvaccination of second-graders at selected schools in selected areas of\nthe country (with the consent of the children\\'s parents, of course).\nThe `Vaccinated` second-graders formed the treatment group. The first\nand third-graders at the schools were not given the vaccination, and\nformed the `Controls` group.\n\nIn the second design (`Experiment == \"RandomizedControl\"`) children were\nselected (again in various schools in various areas), all of whose\nparents consented to vaccination. The sample was randomly divided into\ntreatment (`Group == \"Vaccinated\"`), given the real polio vaccination,\nand control groups (`Group == \"Placebo\"`), a placebo dose that looked\njust like the real vaccine. The experiment was also double blind:\nneither the parents of a child in the study nor the doctors treating the\nchild knew which group the child belonged to.\n\nIn both experiments, `NotInnoculated` refers to children who did not\nparticipate in the experiment. `IncompleteVaccinations` refers to\nchildren who received one or two, but not all three administrations of\nthe vaccine.\n\n### Source\n\nKyle Siegrist, \\\"Virtual Laboratories in Probability and Statistics\\\",\n<http://www.math.uah.edu/stat/data/Polio.html>\n\nThomas Francis, Robert Korn, et al.

When the actual positions of Jupiter and Saturn\nwere compared with the tabulated observations of many centuries, it\nappeared that the mean motion of Jupiter was accelerating, whereas that\nof Saturn was retarding. Halley was able to improve the accuracy of the\ntables by an empirical adjustment, and he speculated that the\nirregularity was somehow due to the mutual attraction of the planets.\nBut he was unable to provide a mathematical theory that would account\nfor this inequality.\n\nIf the observed trends were to continue indefinitely, Jupiter would\ncrash into the sun as Saturn receded into space! The problem posed by\nthe Academy could be (and was) interpreted as requiring the development\nof an extension of existing theories of attraction to incorporate the\nmutual attraction of three bodies, in order to see whether such a theory\ncould account for at least the major observed inequalities as, it was\nhoped, periodic in nature. Thus stability would be restored to the solar\nsystem, and Newtonian gravitational theory would have overcome another\nobstacle.\n\nThe problem was an extraordinarily difficult one for the time, and\nEuler\\'s attempts to grope for a solution are most revealing. Euler\\'s\nwork was, in comparison with Mayer\\'s a year later, a statistical\nfailure. After he had found values for *n* and *u*, Euler had the data\nneeded to produce seventy-five equations, all linear in *x, y, m, z, a*,\nand *k*. He might have added them together in six groups and solved for\nthe unknowns, but he attempted no such overall combination of the\nequations.\n\nLaplace had come quite a bit closer to providing a general method than\n`Mayer` had. Indeed, it was Laplace\\'s generalization that enjoyed\npopularity throughout the first half of the nineteenth century, as a\nmethod that provided some of the accuracy expected from least squares,\nwith much less labor.

Another data frame provides boundaries of a tessellation of\nthe map into Thiessen (Voronoi) regions which include all cholera deaths\nnearer to a given pump than to any other.\n\nThe apocryphal story of the significance of Snow\\'s map is that, by\nclosing the Broad Street pump (by removing its handle), Dr. Snow stopped\nthe epidemic, and demonstrated that cholera is a water borne disease.\nThe method of contagion of cholera was not previously understood.\nSnow\\'s map is the most famous and classical example in the field of\nmedical cartography, even if it didn\\'t happen exactly this way. (the\napocryphal part is that the epidemic ended when the pump handle was\nremoved.) At any rate, the map, together with various statistical\nannotations, is compelling because it points to the Broad Street pump as\nthe source of the outbreak.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\n`Snow.deaths`: A data frame with 578 observations on the following 3\nvariables, giving the address of a person who died from cholera. When\nmany points are associated with a single street address, they are\n\\\"stacked\\\" in a line away from the street so that they are more easily\nvisualized. This is how they are displayed on John Snow\\'s original map.\nThe dates of the deaths are not individually recorded in this data set.\n\n`case`\n\n:   Sequential case number, in some arbitrary, randomized order\n\n`x`\n\n:   x coordinate\n\n`y`\n\n:   y coordinate\n\n`Snow.pumps`: A data frame with 13 observations on the following 4\nvariables, giving the locations of water pumps within the boundaries of\nthe map.\n\n`pump`\n\n:   pump number\n\n`label`\n\n:   pump label: `Briddle St` `Broad St` \\... `Warwick`\n\n`x`\n\n:   x coordinate\n\n`y`\n\n:   y coordinate\n\n`Snow.streets`: A data frame with 1241 observations on the following 4\nvariables, giving coordinates used to draw the 528 street segment lines\nwithin the boundaries of the map.

There are a total of 616\ndeaths represented in both columns `attacks` and `deaths`; of these, the\ndate of the attack is unknown for 45 cases.\n\n### Details\n\nThe scale of the source map is approx. 1:2000. The `(x, y)` coordinate\nunits are 100 meters, with an arbitrary origin.\n\nOf the data in the `Snow.dates` table, Snow says, \"The deaths in the\nabove table are compiled from the sources mentioned above in describing\nthe map; but some deaths which were omitted from the map on account of\nthe number of the house not being known, are included in the table.\"\n\nOne limitation of these data sets is the lack of exact street addresses.\nAnother is the lack of any data that would serve as a population\ndenominator to allow for a comparison of mortality rates in the Broad\nStreet pump area as opposed to others.

His\ngoal was to demonstrate the greater vigour of the cross-fertilized\nplants. The data recorded are the final height (inches, to the nearest\n1/8th) of the plants in each pair.\n\nIn the *Design of Experiments*, Fisher (1935) used these data to\nillustrate a paired t-test (well, a one-sample test on the mean\ndifference, `cross - self`). Later in the book (section 21), he used\nthis data to illustrate an early example of a non-parametric permutation\ntest, treating each paired difference as having (randomly) either a\npositive or negative sign.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA data frame with 15 observations on the following 4 variables.\n\n`pair`\n\n:   pair number, a numeric vector\n\n`pot`\n\n:   pot, a factor with levels `1` `2` `3` `4`\n\n`cross`\n\n:   height of cross fertilized plant, a numeric vector\n\n`self`\n\n:   height of self fertilized plant, a numeric vector\n\n`diff`\n\n:   `cross - self` for each pair\n\n### Details\n\nIn addition to the standard paired t-test, several types of\nnon-parametric tests can be contemplated:\n\n\\(a\\) Permutation test, where the values of, say `self` are permuted and\n`diff=cross - self` is calculated for each permutation. There are 15!\npermutations, but a reasonably large number of random permutations would\nsuffice. But this doesn\\'t take the paired samples into account.\n\n\\(b\\) Permutation test based on assigning each `abs(diff)` a + or -\nsign, and calculating the mean(diff). There are `2^{15}`{.reqn} such\npossible values. This is essentially what Fisher proposed. The p-value\nfor the test is the proportion of absolute mean differences under such\nrandomization which exceed the observed mean difference.\n\n\\(c\\) Wilcoxon signed rank test: tests the hypothesis that the median\nsigned rank of the `diff` is zero, or that the distribution of `diff` is\nsymmetric about 0, vs. a location shifted alternative.\n\n### Source\n\nDarwin, C.

The noise was played from a pair of\nspeakers and a signal was added to just one channel; the subject had to\nturn his/her head to the channel with the added signal. The signal was\neither coherent (the amplitude of the noise was increased for a period)\nor incoherent (independent noise was added for the same period to form\nthe same increase in power).\n\nThe threshold used in the original analysis was the stimulus loudness\nneeds to get 75% correct responses. Some of the children had suffered\nfrom otitis media with effusion (OME).\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nThe `OME` data frame has 1129 rows and 7 columns:\n\n`ID`\n\n:   Subject ID (1 to 99, with some IDs missing). A few subjects were\n    measured at different ages.\n\n`OME`\n\n:   `\"low\"` or `\"high\"` or `\"N/A\"` (at ages other than 30 and 60\n    months).\n\n`Age`\n\n:   Age of the subject (months).\n\n`Loud`\n\n:   Loudness of stimulus, in decibels.\n\n`Noise`\n\n:   Whether the signal in the stimulus was `\"coherent\"` or\n    `\"incoherent\"`.\n\n`Correct`\n\n:   Number of correct responses from `Trials` trials.\n\n`Trials`\n\n:   Number of trials performed.\n\n### Background\n\nThe experiment was to study otitis media with effusion (OME), a very\ncommon childhood condition where the middle ear space, which is normally\nair-filled, becomes congested by a fluid. There is a concomitant\nfluctuating, conductive hearing loss which can result in various\nlanguage, cognitive and social deficits. The term 'binaural hearing' is\nused to describe the listening conditions in which the brain is\nprocessing information from both ears at the same time. The brain\ncomputes differences in the intensity and/or timing of signals arriving\nat each ear which contributes to sound localisation and also to our\nability to hear in background noise.\n\nSome years ago, it was found that children of 7--8 years with a history\nof significant OME had significantly worse binaural hearing than\nchildren without such a history, despite having equivalent sensitivity.\nThe question remained as to whether it was the timing, the duration, or\nthe degree of severity of the otitis media episodes during critical\nperiods, which affected later binaural hearing. In an attempt to begin\nto answer this question, 95 children were monitored for the presence of\neffusion every month since birth. On the basis of OME experience in\ntheir first two years, the test population was split into one group of\nhigh OME prevalence and one of low prevalence.\n\n### Source\n\nSarah Hogan, Dept of Physiology, University of Oxford, via Dept of\nStatistics Consulting Service\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/MASS/OME.csv"))

The biochemical recurrence-free survival rate 5 years\nafter prostatectomy ranges from 70% to 90%. Improvements in the surgical\ntechnique have decreased the amount of intraoperative blood loss\noccurring during radical prostatectomy; however, substantial numbers of\npatients still require perioperative blood transfusions.\\\nBlood transfusions are associated with adverse reactions, including\npostoperative infections and transfusion-related immune perturbations.\nAllogeneic leukocytes present in the transfused blood are thought to\nsuppress host cellular immune responses. Furthermore, the\nimmunodepressant effect is secondary to an imbalance of accumulated\ncytokines and proinflammatory mediators in the transfused blood against\ndecreased production of lymphocyte stimulating cell-mediated cytokines,\nsuch as interleukin 2 and increased release of immunosuppressive\nprostaglandins in the patient undergoing transfusion.\\\nIn cancer patients, perioperative blood transfusion has long been\nsuspected of reducing long-term survival, but available evidence is\ninconsistent. It is also unclear which components of transfused blood\nunderlie the cancer-promoting effects reported by some studies. An\nimportant factor associated with the deleterious effects of blood\ntransfusion is the storage age of the transfused blood units. It is\nsuspected that cancer recurrence may be worsened after the transfusion\nof older blood.\\\n\\\n\n#### Study Objective\n\nThis study evaluated the association between red blood cells (RBC)\nstorage duration and biochemical prostate cancer recurrence after\nradical prostatectomy. Specifically, tested was the hypothesis that\nperioperative transfusion of allogeneic RBCs stored for a prolonged\nperiod is associated with earlier biochemical recurrence of prostate\ncancer after prostatectomy.\\\n\\\n\n#### Subjects and Variables\n\nPatients were assigned to 1 of 3 RBC age exposure groups on the basis of\nthe terciles (ie, the 33rd and 66th percentiles) of the overall\ndistribution of RBC storage duration if all their transfused units could\nbe loosely characterized as of \\'younger,\\' \\'middle,\\' or \\'older\\'\nage. Although this approach resulted in the removal of certain patients\nwith wide RBC age distributions, it has the advantage of defining an\nessentially random and clearly separable exposure.\\\nProstate-specific antigen (PSA) was used as a biochemical marker of\nprostate cancer recurrence after prostatectomy. A PSA value of at least\n0.4 ng/mL (to convert to microg/L, multiply by 1.0) followed by another\nincrease was considered biochemical cancer recurrence.\\\n\\\nThe initial population consisted of 865 men who had undergone radical\nprostatectomy and received transfusion during or within 30 days of the\nsurgical procedure at Cleveland Clinic and had available PSA follow-up\ndata. Of these patients, 110 were excluded from the analysis because\nthey received a combination of allogeneic and autologous blood products.\nOf the remaining 755 patients, 405 (54%) received solely allogeneic and\n350 patients (46%) received solely autologous RBC units. Of the 405\npatients who received allogeneic RBC transfusion, 89 were excluded\nbecause their transfused RBC age distribution included more than one of\nthe terciles. Thus, this dataset consists of the 316 patients who\nreceived solely allogeneic blood products and could be classified into\nan RBC age exposure group.\\\n\n### Source\n\nCata et al. \\'Blood Storage Duration and Biochemical Recurrence of\nCancer after Radical Prostatectomy\\'.

The primary outcome is presence of and time to\ncytomegalovirus reactivation. The dataset is cleaned and relatively\ncomplete. There are no outliers or data problems.\\\n\\\n\n#### Background \n\nHematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is the transplantation of\nmultipotent hematopoietic stem cells, from bone marrow, peripheral\nblood, or umbilical cord blood. It is a medical procedure most often\nperformed for patients with certain cancers of the blood or bone marrow,\nsuch as multiple myeloma or leukemia. Allogeneic HSCT involves two\npeople: the (healthy) donor and the (patient) recipient. Allogeneic HSC\ndonors must have a tissue (HLA) type that matches the recipient.\\\nIn myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, chemotherapy or irradiation is given\nimmediately prior to a transplant (the conditioning regimen) with the\npurpose of eradicating the patient\\'s disease prior to the infusion of\nHSC and to suppress immune reactions. The bone marrow can be ablated\n(destroyed) with dose- levels that cause minimal injury to other\ntissues. For many patients who are at high risk for transplant-related\nmortality with myeloablative allogeneic HSCT, reduced- intensity\nconditioning allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplant has proven\neffective. Although the reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HSCT\nmay avoid many of the organ toxicities associated with myeloablative\nconditioning, the risk for developing graft-versus-host disease and\ninfection including cytomegalovirus remains significant.\\\nCytomegalovirus (CMV) is a common virus that can infect almost anyone.\nOnce infected, your body retains the virus for life. Most people don\\'t\nknow they have CMV because it rarely causes problems in healthy people.\nBut if pregnant or having a weakened immune system, CMV is cause for\nconcern. For people with compromised immunity, such as after allogeneic\nHSCT, CMV infection can be fatal. Natural killer (NK) and T cells\nprovide protection against CMV reactivation. The reactivity of NK cells\nand some T-cell subsets are regulated by the interaction of killer\nimmunoglobulin-like receptors (KIRs) with target cell HLA class 1\nmolecules. The donor activating KIR genotype has been implicated as a\ncontributing factor for CMV reactivation after myeloablative allogeneic\nHSCT.\\\n\\\n\n#### Study Objective\n\nThis study investigates whether donor KIR genotype influences\nreactivation of CMV after T-cell replete, matched sibling donor\nreduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic HSCT.\\\n\\\n\n#### Subjects and Variables\n\nThe study included 64 consecutive patients who underwent T-cell replete,\nmatched sibling donor reduced-intensity conditioning allogeneic\nhematopoietic stem cell transplant between January 16, 2000 and April\n24, 2007 at the Cleveland Clinic. Human leucocyte antigen (HLA) typing\non donors and recipients was performed to allow assessment of killer\nimmunoglobulin-like receptor ligands (KIRs). To allow for comparison\nwith previous studies, donors were categorized as having 1-4 or 5-6\nactivating killer immunoglobulin-like receptor genes (aKIRs).\\\nCMV reactivation was defined as any detection of cytomegalovirus DNA in\nthe blood; the lower detection limit for this assay was 600 copies/mL.\\\n\\\nThe initial population consisted of 865 men who had undergone radical\nprostatectomy and received transfusion during or within 30 days of the\nsurgical procedure at Cleveland Clinic and had available PSA follow-up\ndata. Of these patients, 110 were excluded from the analysis because\nthey received a combination of allogeneic and autologous blood products.\nOf the remaining 755 patients, 405 (54%) received solely allogeneic and\n350 patients (46%) received solely autologous RBC units. Of the 405\npatients who received allogeneic RBC transfusion, 89 were excluded\nbecause their transfused RBC age distribution included more than one of\nthe terciles. Thus, this dataset consists of the 316 patients who\nreceived solely allogeneic blood products and could be classified into\nan RBC age exposure group.\\\n\n### Source\n\nSobecks et al. \\'Cytomegalovirus Reactivation After Matched Sibling\nDonor Reduced-Intensity Conditioning Allogeneic Hematopoietic Stem Cell\nTransplant Correlates With Donor Killer Immunoglobulin-like Receptor\nGenotype\\'.

ERCP is helpful for treating blockages of flow of\nbile (gallstones, cancer), or diagnosing cancers of the pancreas, but\nhas a high rate of complications (15-25%).\\\nThe occurrence of post-ERCP pancreatitis is a common and feared\ncomplication, as pancreatitis can result in multisystem organ failure\nand death, and can occur in \\~ 16% of ERCP procedures.\\\nThe inflammatory cytokine storm that can result from this procedural\ncomplication can be quite severe. Several small randomized trials\nsuggested that anti-inflammatory NSAID therapies at the time of ERCP\ncould reduce the rate of this complication, but all were rather small\nsingle-center studies, and were not sufficiently convincing to change\npractice.\\\nElmunzer, Higgins, and colleagues performed a\n[meta-analysis](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/18375470/) of these\nsmall trials, which suggested that this was a significant effect, and\nthat indomethacin could result in a 64% reduction in post-ERCP\npancreatitis.\\\nThe investigators took this as a possible over-estimate of the effect\n(due to publication bias), and designed a multicenter RCT of a planned\n948 patients to see a reduction of 50% from a placebo rate of 10% to an\nindomethacin rate of 5%. Two interim analyses were performed, after 400\nand 600 patients were enrolled, using an alpha spending function. The\nData and Safety Monitoring Board stopped the study after 602\nparticipants were enrolled because of the significantly positive effect\nof indomethacin, which reduced post-ERCP pancreatitis from 16% in the\nplacebo group to 9% in the indomethacin group.\\\nYou can find the manuscript at [Indomethacin to Prevent Post-ERCP\nPancreatitis](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1111103).\\\n\n### Source\n\nThis data set is sourced from the authors of the 2012 manuscript in the\nNew England Journal of Medicine, entitled, A Randomized Trial of Rectal\nIndomethacin to Prevent Post-ERCP Pancreatitis, pages 1414-1422 volume\n366, in the April 12, 2012 edition, authored by the Elmunzer, BJ,\nHiggins PDR, et al.

It can be administered by the intravenous, oral, or rectal\nsuppository routes. Some of the indomethacin is excreted in the bile and\nreabsorbed by the intestine. This phenomenon, called enterohepatic\ncirculation, keeps the drug around longer than would be expected\notherwise.\\\nEach subject in Study 1 (intravenous route) received a single 50 mg dose\nof radioactively labeled indomethacin (\\^14\\^-carbon-labeled, with each\ndose containing 25 microCuries of radioactivity). Subjects received a\nstandard meal (one 8-oz can of Metrecal, 8 oz of whole milk, and one\nmedium-size apple) 30 rain prior to medication and 8 oz of water every 2\nhr throughout the waking hours to ensure adequate urine output.\\\nBlood samples were taken at frequent intervals over the first 8 hours\nafter dosing, and the quantity of indomethacin in the plasma (as well as\nstool and urine) at each time point was measured in micrograms per\nmilliliter. This data set only contains the plasma measurements from\nTable 1 on page 258 of the manuscript. While this paper was published in\n1976 (post-Tuskegee reveal), there is no mention of ethics review, IRB\nreview, or consent of the healthy volunteers.\\\nThe abstract from the original manuscript:\\\nThere are no discernible quantitative differences in the\nbiotransformation and the excretion of indomethacin following oral,\nrectal, and intravenous administration of indomethacin-2-\\^14\\^C.\nApproximately 50% (range 24-115% for n = 6) of an intravenous dose\nundergoes enterohepatic circulation. Thus the bioavailability of\nindomethacin to the systemic circulation may exceed the administered\ndose. Relative to the intravenous dose, indomethacin is 80 and 100%\nbioavailable from suppositories and capsules, respectively. Absorption\nand/or reabsorption appears to be more rapid and uniform by the rectal\nroute. Recognition of the attributes of biliary recycling also helps to\nexplain the observed variability in apparent plasma half-life, while\ntheir neglect requires alternative explanations for anomalies between\nthe disappearance rate from plasma and the corresponding appearance rate\nin urine.\\\n\n### Source\n\nKwan, Breault, Umbenhauer, McMahon and Duggan (1976) Kinetics of\nIndomethacin absorption, elimination, and enterohepatic circulation in\nman.

Because a good laryngeal\nview facilitates successful tracheal intubation, new technologies have\nbeen introduced to improve visualization. Video laryngoscopes, for\nexample, often use miniature cameras to facilitate visualization of the\nlaryngeal inlet with no need to align the oral, pharyngeal, and tracheal\naxes.\\\nThe Pentax AWS is a novel video laryngoscope, available in Japan since\n2006, which is designed to facilitate intubation by providing a video\nimage of the glottis. It incorporates a miniature video camera and a\nbattery-powered, built-in LCD monitor. A disposable blade is attached to\nthe base system. Incorporation of an LCD display makes it possible to\nview the glottis simultaneously with insertion of the endotracheal tube\n(ETT). In this regard, it differs from some other video laryngoscope\ndesigns that use external monitors. The Pentax AWS also differs in\nhaving a side channel that positions and guides the ETT. Reports suggest\nthat the Pentax AWS can help intubate, but randomized data remain\nsparse.cr This study tested the hypothesis that intubation with the\nPentax AWS would be easier and faster than with a standard Macintosh\nlaryngoscope with a #4 blade.\\\n\\\n\n### Source\n\nThese are data from a study by Abdallah et al.

Available at https://www.causeweb.org/tshs/licorice-gargle/.\\\nPostoperative sore throat is a common and annoying complication of\nendotracheal intubation. Intubation with double-lumen tubes, which are\nmuch larger than conventional single-lumen tubes, are especially likely\nto provoke sore throats, with a reported incidence up to 90%.\nPresumably, postoperative sore throats are a consequence of local tissue\ntrauma, due to laryngoscopy and/or endotracheal intubation, leading to\ninflammation of pharyngeal mucosa.\\\nNonpharmacological methods for preventing an intubation-related sore\nthroat include using smaller-sized endotracheal tubes, lubricating the\nendotracheal tube with water-soluble jelly, and careful airway\ninstrumentation as examples. Pharmacological measures for attenuating\npostoperative sore throats include inhalation of beclomethasone or\nfluticasone propionate; gargling with azulene sulfonate, aspirin, or\nketamine; and gargling or spraying benzydamine hydrochloride on the\nendotracheal cuff for example. Each of these approaches and others not\nlisted, however, has limitations and variable success rates; thus none\nhas become established or is in routine clinical use.\\\nRecently, a study reported that gargling with licorice halves the risk\nof sore throat after intubation with conventional endotracheal tubes,\nbased on a study of just 40 patients. A number of active ingredients\nhave been isolated from licorice, including glycyrrhizin, liquilitin,\nliquiritigenin, and glabridin. The glycyrrhizin component reportedly has\nanti-inflammatory and antiallergic properties. Liquilitin and\nliquiritigenin have peripheral and central antitussive properties.\nGlabridin has significant antioxidant and ulcer-healing properties,\nwhich might help heal pharyngeal and tracheal mucosa after minor\ninjuries that often complicate laryngoscopy, intubation, and\nendotracheal tube cuff inflation.\\\nThis study tested the hypothesis that gargling with licorice solution\nimmediately before induction of anesthesia prevents sore throat and\npostextubation coughing in patients intubated with double-lumen tubes.\\\n\n### Source\n\nThese are data from a study by Ruetzler et al. \\'A Randomized,\nDouble-Blind Comparison of Licorice Versus Sugar-Water Gargle for\nPrevention of Postoperative Sore Throat and Postextubation Coughing\\'.\nAnesth Analg 2013; 117: 614 -- 21.\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/medicaldata/licorice_gargle.csv"))

Can Reduce Preterm Birth Risk.\\\nMaternal periodontal disease has been linked in observational studies to\npreterm birth (\\< 37 weeks) and low birth weight (\\< 2500 g) outcomes.\nThe Obstetrics and Periodontal Therapy study was a multi-center\nrandomized trial evaluating the effect of nonsurgical periodontal\ntreatment intervention on preterm birth, comparing outcomes of women\ntreated before 21 weeks gestation (treatment) to those treated after\ndelivery (control).\\\nPreterm birth, defined as delivery before 37 weeks of gestation, is a\ngrowing problem. In some cases, preterm birth can lead to infant death;\nin others, its consequences may include neurodevelopmental disabilities,\ncognitive impairment, and/or respiratory disorders in the child. Many\nrisk factors for preterm birth have already been identified, including\nmaternal age, drug use, and diabetes. However, such factors are\nexhibited in only about half of preterm birth mothers, highlighting a\nneed to expand our understanding of what contributes to preterm birth\nrisk.\\\nSeveral observational studies have suggested an association between\nmaternal periodontal disease and preterm birth. Periodontal disease is\nan inflammatory condition characterized by the destruction of tissue\nand/or bone around the teeth. A major component of periodontal disease\nis oral colonization by gram-negative bacteria; systemic release of\ncytokines and/or lipopolysaccharides from these bacteria may impact\nfetal condition.\\\nInoculation of the periodontal pathogen P. gingivalis into pregnant\nanimals does have a dose-dependent effect on birth weight and preterm\nbirth signaling, but no such causal link has been shown in humans, only\nsome associations. Though not definitive, the possibility of a\nsignificant relationship raises the question of whether treatment of\nmaternal periodontal disease can decrease preterm birth risk.\\\n\n#### Participants:\n\n823 participants enrolled at 4 centers underwent stratified\nrandomization, resulting in 413 women assigned to the treatment group\nand 410 to control. All participants were 13-16 weeks pregnant at time\nof randomization (baseline/visit 1) and went on to attend monthly\nfollow-up visits defined as visits 2, 3, 4, and 5 corresponding to\ngestational age ranges of 17-20, 21-24, 25-28, and 29-32 weeks.\\\n\n#### Treatment:\n\nThe treatment group received periodontal treatment, oral hygiene\ninstruction, and tooth polishing at their follow-ups, while those\nassigned to control underwent only brief oral exams. Data collection\noccurred at visits 1 (baseline), 3, and 5. The primary outcome of\ninterest is gestational age at end of pregnancy. Additional outcomes\ninclude birthweight, clinical measures of periodontal disease, and\nvarious microbiological and immunological outcomes.\\\n\n#### Analysis:\n\nStatistical analyses were carried out on an intent-to-treat basis.\nGestational age can be thought of as \\'time until end of pregnancy,\\'\nfor which certain survival analysis methods would be appropriate. The\nstudy used a log-rank test stratified by center to compare time until\nend of pregnancy for treatment and control groups.\\\nA semiparametric proportional hazards model was also used for this\npurpose and incorporated maternal risk factors as predictors. For the\nstudy\\'s main analyses, gestational age was censored at 37 weeks (259\ndays) because the interest was in extending pregnancies that would\notherwise end pre-term, not extending pregnancies generally.\\\nThough not used in the study itself, logistic regression is another\nmethod that could be applied: for example, to gestational age,\ndichotomized as \\'preterm\\' or \\'not preterm\\' according to a\ngestational age cutoff, or to birthweight dichotomized as \\'low\\' or\n\\'high\\' at the 2500 g or other cutoff (2500 g would be in keeping with\nthe World Health Organization\\'s definition for low birth weight).\nChanges in clinical measures of periodontal disease from baseline to\nvisits 3 or 5 could be analyzed using mixed effects linear models. The\ndataset also features a number of baseline characteristics, which could\nbe compared in treatment and control groups via Student t-tests,\nWilcoxon rank sum tests, Fisher\\'s exact tests or Pearson\\'s chi-square\ntests, as appropriate.\\\n\n#### Publishing:\n\nThe nonsurgical periodontal treatment involving scaling and root planing\ninduced significant improvements in periodontal health. The study did\nnot however find a significant relation between periodontal treatment\nand preterm birth risk. The results of this study were published in 2006\nby Michalowicz et al., \\'Treatment of periodontal disease and the risk\nof preterm birth\\', in The New England Journal of Medicine.

Scurvy\ncould be fatal on long voyages. James Lind reported the treatment of 12\nseamen with scurvy in 1757, in *A Treatise on the Scurvy in Three\nParts*. This 476 page bloviation can be found scanned to the Google\nBooks website [A Treatise on the\nScurvy](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Treatise_on_the_Scurvy/oP1UEXWU7fsC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover).\nPages 149-153 are a rare gem among what can be generously described as\n400+ pages of evidence-free blathering, and these 4 pages may represent\nthe first report of a controlled clinical trial.\\\nLind was the ship\\'s surgeon on board the HMS Salisbury, and had a\nnumber of scurvy-affected seamen at his disposal. Many remedies had been\ndescribed and advocated for, with no more than anecdotal evidence. On\nMay 20, 1747, Lind decided to try the 6 available therapies at his\ndisposal in a comparative study in 12 affected seamen. He selected 12\nwith roughly similar severity, with notable skin and mouth sores,\nweakness of the knees, and significant lassitude, making them unfit for\nduty. They each received the standard shipboard diet of gruel and mutton\nbroth, supplemented with occasional biscuits and puddings. Each\ntreatment was a dietary supplement (including citrus fruits) or a\nmedicinal.\\\nThis data frame was reconstructed from Lind\\'s account as recorded on\nthese 4 pages, with his estimates of severity translated to a 4 point\nLikert scale (0-3) for each of the symptoms he described at his chosen\nendpoint on day 6. A fanciful study_id variable was added, along with\ndetailed descriptions of the dosing schedule of each treatment.\\\nOf note, there is some dispute about whether this was truly the first\nclinical trial, or whether it actually happened. See link about the\n[historical\ndebate](https://www.bbvaopenmind.com/en/science/leading-figures/james-lind-and-scurvy-the-first-clinical-trial-in-history/).\nLind reported that the seamen treated with 2 lemons and an orange daily\ndid best, followed by those treated with cider. Those treated with\nelixir of vitriol only had improvement in mouth sores. One imagines that\nacidic substances (like dilute sulfuric acid, vinegar, cider, and citrus\nfruits) might have been rather painful on these mouth sores.\nUnfortunately, the burial of 4 valuable pages of data in 476 pages of\nnoise, a publication delay of 10 years, and Lind\\'s half-hearted\nconclusions, meant that it took until 1795 before the British Navy\nmandated daily limes for seamen.\\\n\n### Source\n\nThis data set is faithfully reconstructed from a report published in\n1757 as *A Treatise on the Scurvy in 3 Parts*, by James Lind, pp.\n149-153, and you can find a scan of the source document that you can\nread yourself on Google Books\n[here](https://www.google.com/books/edition/A_Treatise_on_the_Scurvy/oP1UEXWU7fsC?hl=en&gbpv=1&printsec=frontcover).\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/medicaldata/scurvy.csv"))

Available\nat https://www.causeweb.org/tshs/smart-pill/.\\\nDelayed gastric emptying is a well-known problem in critically ill\npatients and is associated with feeding disturbances and inadequate\nnutrition. However, evaluating gastrointestinal function remains\nchallenging in critically ill patients who are mechanically ventilated.\nMany tests that are practical and accurate under standardized,\ncontrolled conditions often fail in the critical care setting. For\nexample, the consensus recommendations for gastric emptying scintigraphy\nare impractical in intubated patients because they recommend low-fat,\negg white meal with imaging at 0, 1, 2, and 4 hours after meal\ningestion. Another test, the lactulose hydrogen breath test, relies on\nprompt bacterial breakdown of lactulose in the colon; however, changes\nin bacterial flora - which are presumably common in critical care\npatients - can produce false transit times.\\\nThe 13C-octanoic acid breath test was reported as successful when used\nbedside to measure gastric emptying. However, manometry only assesses\nthe upper gastrointestinal function, mainly esophagus, stomach, and\nproximal small bowel. Finally, video capsule technology has been used to\ndetermine small bowel transit time and pathomorphology in critically ill\npatients, although inadequate battery lifespan of the capsule\n(approximately 8-10 hours) could prevent complete examination in some\ncases.\\\nAn alternative technique, wireless capsule technology, may be useful for\nevaluating gastrointestinal motility in critical care patients. A newly\ndeveloped motility capsule for assessing gastric emptying in patients\nwith suspected gastroparesis has been available since 2006. It is a\nwireless capsule that transmits pH, pressure, and temperature.\\\nThis study describes the first use of a novel motility capsule to\ncompare gastric emptying and small bowel transit times in critically ill\ntrauma patients with intracranial hemorrhage with times recorded\npreviously in healthy volunteers. Secondly, this study compares\ncritically ill patients and volunteers on whole-gut transit time.\\\n\n### Source\n\nRauch et al. \\'Use of Wireless Utility Capsule to Determine Gastric\nEmptying and Small Intestinal Transit Times in Critically Ill Trauma\nPatients\\'.

Patients having painful\nprocedures who undergo general anesthesia have a 2- to 5-fold greater\nrisk of unplanned overnight admissions compared with those having\nregional anesthesia. Regional anesthetic techniques and peripheral nerve\nblocks are especially favored for surgeries on the extremities. Both\nrapid onset of the block and prolonged postoperative analgesia are\ndesired characteristics of regional anesthesia.\\\nThe choice of local anesthetics or combinations thereof can greatly\ninfluence the effectiveness of the block, onset time, duration of\npostoperative analgesia, need for opioid use, and patient satisfaction.\nMepivacaine and ropivacaine are commonly used in peripheral nerve\nblocks, their drawbacks being a short duration with 1.5% mepivacaine and\na delayed onset with 0.5% ropivacaine. An ideal local anesthetic with\nhigh potency, low toxicity, rapid onset, and prolonged duration does not\nexist yet. Investigators have therefore tried mixtures of local\nanesthetics in an attempt to combine their advantages with conflicting\nresults. A potential problem is that mixing drugs dilutes the effects of\neach. Thus, a mixture of a rapid-onset drug such as mepivacaine with a\nlong-acting one such as ropivacaine may well result in slower onset than\nmepivacaine alone and shorter duration of action than ropivacaine alone.\nIn contrast, sequential administration of the same amounts of the same\ndrugs may preserve the desirable features of each.\\\nObjective: This study investigates whether sequential supraclavicular\ninjection of 1.5% mepivacaine followed 90 seconds later by 0.5%\nropivacaine provides a quicker onset and a longer duration of analgesia\nthan an equidose combination of the 2 local anesthetics.\\\n\n### Source\n\nThese are data from a study by Roberman et al. \\'Combined Versus\nSequential Injection of Mepivacaine and Ropivacaine for Supraclavicular\nNerve Blocks\\'.

Upton around 1980. The original publication,\nif any, is unclear and not cited. These data were used in a package\nnamed `nlme`, and reported in Boeckmann, A.J., et al.Dr. Upton did\npublish several papers on theophylline pharmacokinetics around\n1980-1984, and these data could have been from one of these.\\\nTheophylline is an methylxanthine anti-asthma medication, which acts as\na bronchodilator, with secondary effects to strengthen diaphragm\ncontraction, reduce pulmonary artery pressures, and reduce mast cell\nrelease. It can be administered by the intravenous, oral, or rectal\nsuppository routes.\\\nEach subject in this Study (oral route) received a single oral dose of\ntheophylline. Blood samples were taken at frequent intervals over the\nfirst 25 hours after dosing, and the quantity of theophylline in the\nplasma at each time point was measured in micrograms per milliliter.\\\nUnfortunately, the theophylline plasma level in blood varies\nconsiderably between patients, because of differences in drug clearance,\nwhich is affected by body mass, age, smoking, liver and heart function,\nand viral infections. To complicate this drug further, it has important\ninteractions with a number of other common medicines which can increase\nor decrease the drug level. Each subject in this study received a single\noral dose of 300 mg of theophylline, which has been converted to a\nmilligrams per kilogram dose. Blood samples were taken at frequent\nintervals over the next 25 hours after dosing, and the quantity of\ntheophylline in the plasma at each time point was measured in micrograms\nper milliliter of plasma.\\\n\n### Source\n\nBoeckmann, A.

The\nobjective in this project was to develop a model to predict percent\nyield of the manufacturing process. The data set consisted of 177\nsamples of biological material for which 57 characteristics were\nmeasured. Of the 57 characteristics, there were 12 measurements of the\nbiological starting material, and 45 measurements of the manufacturing\nprocess. The process variables included measurements such as\ntemperature, drying time, washing time, and concentrations of\nby-products at various steps. Some of the process measurements can be\ncontrolled, while others are observed.

In short, permeability is the measure of a\nmolecule\\'s ability to cross a membrane. The body, for example, has\nnotable membranes between the body and brain, known as the blood-brain\nbarrier, and between the gut and body in the intestines. These membranes\nhelp the body guard critical regions from receiving undesirable or\ndetrimental substances. For an orally taken drug to be effective in the\nbrain, it first must pass through the intestinal wall and then must pass\nthrough the blood-brain barrier in order to be present for the desired\nneurological target. Therefore, a compound\\'s ability to permeate\nrelevant biological membranes is critically important to understand\nearly in the drug discovery process. Compounds that appear to be\neffective for a particular disease in research screening experiments,\nbut appear to be poorly permeable may need to be altered in order\nimprove permeability, and thus the compound\\'s ability to reach the\ndesired target. Identifying permeability problems can help guide\nchemists towards better molecules.\n\nPermeability assays such as PAMPA and Caco-2 have been developed to help\nmeasure compounds\\' permeability (Kansy et al, 1998). These screens are\neffective at quantifying a compound\\'s permeability, but the assay is\nexpensive labor intensive. Given a sufficient number of compounds that\nhave been screened, we could develop a predictive model for permeability\nin an attempt to potentially reduce the need for the assay. In this\nproject there were 165 unique compounds; 1107 molecular fingerprints\nwere determined for each. A molecular fingerprint is a binary sequence\nof numbers that represents the presence or absence of a specific\nmolecular sub-structure. The response is highly skewed, the predictors\nare sparse (15.5% are present), and many predictors are strongly\nassociated.\n\nColumns:\n\n-   `permeability`: numeric\n\n-   `chem_fp_0001` - `chem_fp_1107`: numeric\n\n### Value\n\n  --------------------- --------------\n  `permeability_qsar`   a data frame\n  --------------------- --------------\n\n### Source\n\nKuhn, Max, and Kjell Johnson. *Applied predictive modeling*.

The\nstudy monitored job postings in Boston and Chicago for several months\nduring 2001 and 2002 and used this to build up a set of test cases. Over\nthis time period, the researchers randomly generating resumes to go out\nto a job posting, such as years of experience and education details, to\ncreate a realistic-looking resume. They then randomly assigned a name to\nthe resume that would communicate the applicant\\'s gender and race. The\nfirst names chosen for the study were selected so that the names would\npredominantly be recognized as belonging to black or white individuals.\nFor example, Lakisha was a name that their survey indicated would be\ninterpreted as a black woman, while Greg was a name that would generally\nbe interpreted to be associated with a white male.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA data frame with 4870 observations, representing 4870 resumes, over 30\ndifferent variables that describe the job details, the outcome\n(`received_callback`), and attributes of the resume.\n\njob_ad_id\n\n:   Unique ID associated with the advertisement.\n\njob_city\n\n:   City where the job was located.\n\njob_industry\n\n:   Industry of the job.\n\njob_type\n\n:   Type of role.\n\njob_fed_contractor\n\n:   Indicator for if the employer is a federal contractor.\n\njob_equal_opp_employer\n\n:   Indicator for if the employer is an Equal Opportunity Employer.\n\njob_ownership\n\n:   The type of company, e.g. a nonprofit or a private company.\n\njob_req_any\n\n:   Indicator for if any job requirements are listed.

You may have\nsome health skepticism. However, do take care to appreciate that this\nwas an experiment: the first name (and so the inferred race and gender)\nwere randomly assigned to the resumes, and the quality and attributes of\na resume were assigned independent of the race and gender. This means\nthat any effects we observe are in fact causal, and the effects related\nto race are both statistically significant and very large: white\napplicants had about a 50\\\\\n\nDo you still have doubts lingering in the back of your mind about the\nvalidity of this study? Maybe a counterargument about why the standard\nconclusions from this study may not apply?

Now in 2018, the UCLA bookstore is about even\nwith Amazon on the vast majority of titles, and there is no statistical\ndifference in the sample data.\n\nThe most expensive book required for the course was generally used.\n\nThe reason why we advocate for using raw amount differences instead of\npercent differences is that a 20\\\\ to a 20\\\\ price difference on\nlow-priced books would balance numerically (but not in a practical\nsense) a moderate but important price difference on more expensive\nbooks. So while this tends to result in a bit less sensitivity in\ndetecting *some* effect, we believe the absolute difference compares\nprices in a more meaningful way.\n\nUsed prices contain the shipping cost but do not contain tax. The used\nprices are a more nuanced comparison, since these are all 3rd party\nsellers. Amazon is often more a marketplace than a retail site at this\npoint, and many people buy from 3rd party sellers on Amazon now without\nrealizing it. The relationship Amazon has with 3rd party sellers is also\nchallenging. Given the frequently changing dynamics in this space, we\ndon\\'t think any analysis here will be very reliable for long term\ninsights since products from these sellers changes frequently in\nquantity and price. For this reason, we focus only on new books sold\ndirectly by Amazon in our comparison. In a future round of data\ncollection, it may be interesting to explore whether the dynamics have\nchanged in the used market.\n\n### Source\n\n<https://sa.ucla.edu/ro/public/soc>\n\n<https://ucla.verbacompare.com>\n\n<https://www.amazon.com>\n\n### See Also\n\n`textbooks`, `ucla_f18`\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/openintro/ucla_textbooks_f18.csv"))

The\nmain take-away: there are 7 cars, as evidenced by the somewhat regular\nincreases in splits between every 7 cars. The reason the times are\nslightly non-constant is that the gondolas come off the tracks, so times\nwill change a little between each period.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA data frame with 52 observations on the following 2 variables.\n\nobs_number\n\n:   The observation number, e.g. observation 3 was immediately preceded\n    by observation 2.\n\ntime_until_next\n\n:   Time until this gondola car arrived since the last car had left.\n\n### Details\n\nImportant context: there was a sufficient line that people were leaving\nthe winery.\n\nSo why is this data valuable? It indicates that the winery should add\none more car since it has a lot of time wasted every 7th car.

The result in the Senate election in the 2nd district\n(based in Philadelphia) was challenged in court, and ultimately\noverturned. The Democratic candidate won 19,127 of the votes cast by\nvoting machine, while the Republican won 19,691 votes cast by voting\nmachine, giving the Republican a lead of 564 votes. However, the\nDemocrat won 1,396 absentee ballots, while the Republican won just 371\nabsentee ballots, more than offsetting the Republican lead based on the\nvotes recorded by machines on election day. The Republican candidate\nsued, claiming that many of the absentee ballots were fraudulent. The\njudge in the case solicited expert analysis from Orley Ashenfelter, an\neconomist at Princeton University. Ashenfelter examined the relationship\nbetween absentee vote margins and machine vote margins in 21 previous\nPennsylvania Senate elections in seven districts in the Philadelphia\narea over the preceding decade.\n\n### Source\n\nAshenfelter, Orley. 1994.

The clusters in this design are\ngeographic areas served by a single cable television system. So as to\nfacilitate analysis, the researchers restricted their attention to small\ncable systems whose reach is limited to a single zip code. Further,\nsince the experiment was fielded during the last week of the\npresidential election, the researchers restricted their search to cable\nsystems that were not in the 16 hotly-contested \"battleground\" states\n(as designated by the *Los Angeles Times*).\n\nEighty-five cable systems were available for randomization and were\nassigned to treatment after stratification on previous turnout levels in\npresidential elections (as determined from analysis of the corresponding\nstates\\' voter registration files). Each cable system was matched with\none or sometimes two other cable systems in the same state, yielding 40\nstrata. Then within each strata, cable systems were randomly assigned to\ntreatment and control conditions. Strata 3, 8 and 25 have two control\ncable systems and 1 treated system each, while strata 6 and 20 have two\ntreated cable systems and one control system. The remaining 35 strata\nhave 1 treated cable system and 1 control system. In this way there are\n38 + 4 = 42 treated systems, spanning 40 experiment strata.\n\nThe treatment involved researchers purchasing prime-time advertising\nspots on four channels in the respective cable system in which the\nresearchers aired voter mobilization ads. The ads were produced by *Rock\nthe Vote*, targeted at younger voters, and aired four times per night,\nper channel, over the last eight days of the election campaign. After\nthe election, public records were consulted to assemble data on turnout\nlevels in the treated and control cable systems. In the analysis\nreported in Green and Vavreck (2008), the researchers focused on turnout\namong registered voters aged 18 and 19 years old.\n\n### References\n\nGreen, Donald P. and Lynn Vavreck. 2008.

(defn psych-Bechtoldt "  ----------- -----------------\n  Bechtoldt     Documentation\n  ----------- -----------------\n\n## Seven data sets showing a bifactor solution.\n\n### Description\n\nHolzinger-Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model of a general\nfactor and uncorrelated group factors. The Holzinger data sets are\noriginal 14 \\* 14 matrix from their paper as well as a 9 \\*9 matrix used\nas an example by Joreskog. The Thurstone correlation matrix is a 9 \\* 9\nmatrix of correlations of ability items. The Reise data set is 16 \\* 16\ncorrelation matrix of mental health items. The Bechtholdt data sets are\nboth 17 x 17 correlation matrices of ability tests.\n\n\n\n### Details\n\nHolzinger and Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model (one\ngeneral factor and several group factors) for mental abilities. This is\na nice demonstration data set of a hierarchical factor structure that\ncan be analyzed using the `omega` function or using sem. The bifactor\nmodel is typically used in measures of cognitive ability.\n\nThere are several ways to analyze such data. One is to use the `omega`\nfunction to do a hierarchical factoring using the Schmid-Leiman\ntransformation. This can then be done as an exploratory and then as a\nconfirmatory model using `omegaSem`. Another way is to do a regular\nfactor analysis and use either a `bifactor` or `biquartimin` rotation.\nThese latter two functions implement the Jennrich and Bentler (2011)\nbifactor and biquartimin transformations. The `bifactor` rotation\nsuffers from the problem of local minima (Mansolf and Reise, 2016) and\nthus a mixture of exploratory and confirmatory analysis might be\npreferred.\n\nThe 14 variables are ordered to reflect 3 spatial tests, 3 mental speed\ntests, 4 motor speed tests, and 4 verbal tests. The sample size is 355.\n\nAnother data set from Holzinger (Holzinger.9) represents 9 cognitive\nabilities (Holzinger, 1939) and is used as an example by Karl Joreskog\n(2003) for factor analysis by the MINRES algorithm and also appears in\nthe LISREL manual as example NPV.KM. This data set represents the scores\nfrom the Grant White middle school for 9 tests: \\\"t01_visperc\\\"\n\\\"t02_cubes\\\" \\\"t04_lozenges\\\" \\\"t06_paracomp\\\" \\\"t07_sentcomp\\\"\n\\\"t09_wordmean\\\" \\\"t10_addition\\\" \\\"t12_countdot\\\" and \\\"t13_sccaps\\\"\nand as variables x1 \\... x9 (for the Grant-White school) in the lavaan\npackage.\n\nAnother classic data set is the 9 variable Thurstone problem which is\ndiscussed in detail by R. P. McDonald (1985, 1999) and and is used as\nexample in the sem package as well as in the PROC CALIS manual for SAS.\nThese nine tests were grouped by Thurstone and Thurstone, 1941 (based on\nother data) into three factors: Verbal Comprehension, Word Fluency, and\nReasoning. The original data came from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941)\nbut were reanalyzed by Bechthold (1961) who broke the data set into two.\nMcDonald, in turn, selected these nine variables from the larger set of\n17 found in Bechtoldt.2. The sample size is 213.\n\nAnother set of 9 cognitive variables attributed to Thurstone (1933) is\nthe data set of 4,175 male students reported by Carl Brigham of\nPrinceton to the College Entrance Examination Board. (Brigham, 1932,\nTable VIII p 352.) This set does not show a clear bifactor solution but\nis included as a demonstration of the differences between a maximimum\nlikelihood factor analysis solution versus a principal axis factor\nsolution. On page 352, we are given reliability estimates of .86, .73,\n.83, .97,.94, .85, .92, .92, and .90. These are based upon sampling 743\nboys.\n\nA parallel set (also from Brigham) is the correlation matrix of the same\n9 variables for 2899 girls. (Thurstone.33G)\n\nTucker (1958) uses 9 variables from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941) for\nhis example of `interbattery` factor analysis.\n\nMore recent applications of the bifactor model are to the measurement of\npsychological status. The Reise data set is a correlation matrix based\nupon \\>35,000 observations to the Consumer Assessment of Health Care\nProvideers and Systems survey instrument. Reise, Morizot, and Hays\n(2007) describe a bifactor solution based upon 1,000 cases.\n\nThe five factors from Reise et al. reflect Getting care quickly (1-3),\nDoctor communicates well (4-7), Courteous and helpful staff (8,9),\nGetting needed care (10-13), and Health plan customer service (14-16).\n\nThe two Bechtoldt data sets are two samples from Thurstone and Thurstone\n(1941). They include 17 variables, 9 of which were used by McDonald to\nform the Thurstone data set. The sample sizes are 212 and 213\nrespectively. The six proposed factors reflect memory, verbal, words,\nspace, number and reasoning with three markers for all expect the rote\nmemory factor. 9 variables from this set appear in the Thurstone data\nset.\n\nTwo more data sets with similar structures are found in the `Harman`\ndata set. This includes the another 9 variables (with 696 subjects) from\nHolzinger used by Harman `link{Harman.Holzinger}` as well as 8 affective\nvariables from `link{burt}`.\n\nAnother data set that is worth examining for tests of bifactor structure\nis the holzinger.swineford data set which includes the original data\nfrom Holzinger and Swineford (1939) supplied by Keith Widaman. This is\nin the psychTools package.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.1: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 212.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.2: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213.\n\n-   Holzinger: 14 x 14 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 355\n\n-   Holzinger.9: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 145\n\n-   Reise: 16 x 16 correlation matrix of health satisfaction items. N =\n    35,000\n\n-   Thurstone: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213\n\n-   Thurstone.33: Another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests,\n    N=4175\n\n-   Thurstone:9: And yet another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability\n    tests, N =710\n\n### Note\n\nNote that these are tests, not items. Thus, it was possible to find the\nreliabilities of each test.\n\nFor the Holzinger 14 tests these were found from 1- t2 where t = c(.332,\n.517, .360, .382, .354,.249, .444, .393, .455, .424, .393, .487, .534,\n.382) (page 53) and thus the reliabilities were 0.890, 0.733, 0.870,\n0.854, 0.875, 0.938, 0.803, 0.846, 0.793, 0.820, 0.846, 0.763, 0.715,\n0.854.\n\nFor the Holzinger.9 tests, the reliabilities for the Grant-White tests\nwere: .76, .57, .94, .65, .75, .87, .95, .84 and .89 (Keith Widaman,\npersonal communication, 2020),\n\n### Source\n\nHolzinger: Holzinger and Swineford (1937)\\\nReise: Steve Reise (personal communication)\\\nsem help page (for Thurstone) Brigham (for Thurstone.33)\n\n### References\n\nBechtoldt, Harold, (1961).

(defn psych-Bechtoldt.1 "  ----------- -----------------\n  Bechtoldt     Documentation\n  ----------- -----------------\n\n## Seven data sets showing a bifactor solution.\n\n### Description\n\nHolzinger-Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model of a general\nfactor and uncorrelated group factors. The Holzinger data sets are\noriginal 14 \\* 14 matrix from their paper as well as a 9 \\*9 matrix used\nas an example by Joreskog. The Thurstone correlation matrix is a 9 \\* 9\nmatrix of correlations of ability items. The Reise data set is 16 \\* 16\ncorrelation matrix of mental health items. The Bechtholdt data sets are\nboth 17 x 17 correlation matrices of ability tests.\n\n\n\n### Details\n\nHolzinger and Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model (one\ngeneral factor and several group factors) for mental abilities. This is\na nice demonstration data set of a hierarchical factor structure that\ncan be analyzed using the `omega` function or using sem. The bifactor\nmodel is typically used in measures of cognitive ability.\n\nThere are several ways to analyze such data. One is to use the `omega`\nfunction to do a hierarchical factoring using the Schmid-Leiman\ntransformation. This can then be done as an exploratory and then as a\nconfirmatory model using `omegaSem`. Another way is to do a regular\nfactor analysis and use either a `bifactor` or `biquartimin` rotation.\nThese latter two functions implement the Jennrich and Bentler (2011)\nbifactor and biquartimin transformations. The `bifactor` rotation\nsuffers from the problem of local minima (Mansolf and Reise, 2016) and\nthus a mixture of exploratory and confirmatory analysis might be\npreferred.\n\nThe 14 variables are ordered to reflect 3 spatial tests, 3 mental speed\ntests, 4 motor speed tests, and 4 verbal tests. The sample size is 355.\n\nAnother data set from Holzinger (Holzinger.9) represents 9 cognitive\nabilities (Holzinger, 1939) and is used as an example by Karl Joreskog\n(2003) for factor analysis by the MINRES algorithm and also appears in\nthe LISREL manual as example NPV.KM. This data set represents the scores\nfrom the Grant White middle school for 9 tests: \\\"t01_visperc\\\"\n\\\"t02_cubes\\\" \\\"t04_lozenges\\\" \\\"t06_paracomp\\\" \\\"t07_sentcomp\\\"\n\\\"t09_wordmean\\\" \\\"t10_addition\\\" \\\"t12_countdot\\\" and \\\"t13_sccaps\\\"\nand as variables x1 \\... x9 (for the Grant-White school) in the lavaan\npackage.\n\nAnother classic data set is the 9 variable Thurstone problem which is\ndiscussed in detail by R. P. McDonald (1985, 1999) and and is used as\nexample in the sem package as well as in the PROC CALIS manual for SAS.\nThese nine tests were grouped by Thurstone and Thurstone, 1941 (based on\nother data) into three factors: Verbal Comprehension, Word Fluency, and\nReasoning. The original data came from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941)\nbut were reanalyzed by Bechthold (1961) who broke the data set into two.\nMcDonald, in turn, selected these nine variables from the larger set of\n17 found in Bechtoldt.2. The sample size is 213.\n\nAnother set of 9 cognitive variables attributed to Thurstone (1933) is\nthe data set of 4,175 male students reported by Carl Brigham of\nPrinceton to the College Entrance Examination Board. (Brigham, 1932,\nTable VIII p 352.) This set does not show a clear bifactor solution but\nis included as a demonstration of the differences between a maximimum\nlikelihood factor analysis solution versus a principal axis factor\nsolution. On page 352, we are given reliability estimates of .86, .73,\n.83, .97,.94, .85, .92, .92, and .90. These are based upon sampling 743\nboys.\n\nA parallel set (also from Brigham) is the correlation matrix of the same\n9 variables for 2899 girls. (Thurstone.33G)\n\nTucker (1958) uses 9 variables from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941) for\nhis example of `interbattery` factor analysis.\n\nMore recent applications of the bifactor model are to the measurement of\npsychological status. The Reise data set is a correlation matrix based\nupon \\>35,000 observations to the Consumer Assessment of Health Care\nProvideers and Systems survey instrument. Reise, Morizot, and Hays\n(2007) describe a bifactor solution based upon 1,000 cases.\n\nThe five factors from Reise et al. reflect Getting care quickly (1-3),\nDoctor communicates well (4-7), Courteous and helpful staff (8,9),\nGetting needed care (10-13), and Health plan customer service (14-16).\n\nThe two Bechtoldt data sets are two samples from Thurstone and Thurstone\n(1941). They include 17 variables, 9 of which were used by McDonald to\nform the Thurstone data set. The sample sizes are 212 and 213\nrespectively. The six proposed factors reflect memory, verbal, words,\nspace, number and reasoning with three markers for all expect the rote\nmemory factor. 9 variables from this set appear in the Thurstone data\nset.\n\nTwo more data sets with similar structures are found in the `Harman`\ndata set. This includes the another 9 variables (with 696 subjects) from\nHolzinger used by Harman `link{Harman.Holzinger}` as well as 8 affective\nvariables from `link{burt}`.\n\nAnother data set that is worth examining for tests of bifactor structure\nis the holzinger.swineford data set which includes the original data\nfrom Holzinger and Swineford (1939) supplied by Keith Widaman. This is\nin the psychTools package.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.1: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 212.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.2: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213.\n\n-   Holzinger: 14 x 14 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 355\n\n-   Holzinger.9: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 145\n\n-   Reise: 16 x 16 correlation matrix of health satisfaction items. N =\n    35,000\n\n-   Thurstone: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213\n\n-   Thurstone.33: Another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests,\n    N=4175\n\n-   Thurstone:9: And yet another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability\n    tests, N =710\n\n### Note\n\nNote that these are tests, not items. Thus, it was possible to find the\nreliabilities of each test.\n\nFor the Holzinger 14 tests these were found from 1- t2 where t = c(.332,\n.517, .360, .382, .354,.249, .444, .393, .455, .424, .393, .487, .534,\n.382) (page 53) and thus the reliabilities were 0.890, 0.733, 0.870,\n0.854, 0.875, 0.938, 0.803, 0.846, 0.793, 0.820, 0.846, 0.763, 0.715,\n0.854.\n\nFor the Holzinger.9 tests, the reliabilities for the Grant-White tests\nwere: .76, .57, .94, .65, .75, .87, .95, .84 and .89 (Keith Widaman,\npersonal communication, 2020),\n\n### Source\n\nHolzinger: Holzinger and Swineford (1937)\\\nReise: Steve Reise (personal communication)\\\nsem help page (for Thurstone) Brigham (for Thurstone.33)\n\n### References\n\nBechtoldt, Harold, (1961).

N =\n    172\n\n-   Harman.5: 12 census tracts for 5 socioeconomic data (Harman p 14)\n\n-   Harman.political: p 166.\n\n-   Harman.8 8 physical measures\n\nHarman.Holzinger. The nine psychological variables from Harman (1967, p\n244) are taken from unpublished class notes of K.J. Holzinger with 696\nparticipants. This is a subset of 12 tests with 4 factors. It is yet\nanother nice example of a bifactor solution. Bentler (2007) uses this\ndata set to discuss reliablity analysis. The data show a clear bifactor\nstructure and are a nice example of the various estimates of reliability\nincluded in the `omega` function. Should not be confused with the\n`Holzinger` or `Holzinger.9` data sets in `bifactor`.\n\nSee also the Holzinger-Swineford data set of 301 subjects with 26\nvariables in `holzinger.swineford`. These data were provided by Keith\nWidaman. \\\"The Holzinger and Swineford (1939) data have been used as a\nmodel data set by many investigators. For example, Harman (1976) used\nthe \\\"24 Psychological Variables\\\" example prominently in his\nauthoritative text on multiple factor analysis, and the data presented\nunder this rubric consisted of 24 of the variables from the Grant-White\nschool (N = 145). Meredith (1964a, 1964b) used several variables from\nthe Holzinger and Swineford study in his work on factorial invariance\nunder selection. Joreskog (1971) based his work on multiple-group\nconfirmatory factor analysis using the Holzinger and Swineford data,\nsubsetting the data into four groups.\n\nRosseel, who developed the \\\"lavaan\\\" package for R , included 9 of the\nmanifest variables from Holzinger and Swineford (1939) as a \\\"resident\\\"\ndata set when one downloads the lavaan package. Several background\nvariables are included in this \\\"resident\\\" data set in addition to 9 of\nthe psychological tests (which are named x1 - x9 in the data set). When\nanalyzing these data, I found the distributions of the variables (means,\nSDs) did not match the sample statistics from the original article. For\nexample, in the \\\"resident\\\" data set in lavaan, scores on all manifest\nvariables ranged between 0 and 10, sample means varied between 3 and 6,\nand sample SDs varied between 1.0 and 1.5. In the original data set,\nscores ranges were rather different across tests, with some variables\nhaving scores that ranged between 0 and 20, but other manifest variables\nhaving scores ranging from 50 to over 300 - with obvious attendant\ndifferences in sample means and SDs.\\\"\n\nHarman.Burt. Eight \"emotional\\\" variables are taken from Harman (1967, p\n164) who in turn adapted them from Burt (1939). They are said be from\n172 normal children aged nine to twelve. As pointed out by Harman, this\ncorrelation matrix is singular and has squared multiple correlations\n\\> 1. Because of this problem, it is a nice test case for various\nfactoring algorithms. (For instance, omega will issue warning messages\nfor fm=\\\"minres\\\" or fm=\\\"pa\\\" but will fail for fm=\\\"ml\\\".)\n\nThe Eight Physical Variables problem is taken from Harman (1976) and\nrepresents the correlations between eight physical variables for 305\ngirls. The two correlated clusters represent four measures of\n\\\"lankiness\\\" and then four measures of \\\"stockiness\\\". The original\ndata were selected from 17 variables reported in an unpublished\ndissertation by Mullen (1939).\n\nVariable 6 (\\\"Bitrochanteric diamter\\\") is the distance between the\nouter points of the hips.\n\nThe row names match the original Harman paper, the column names have\nbeen abbreviated.\n\nSee also the `usaf` data set for other physical measurements.\n\nThe `fa` solution for principal axes (fm=\\\"pa\\\") matches the reported\nminres solution, as does the fm=\\\"minres\\\".\n\nFor those interested in teaching examples using various body\nmeasurements, see the body data set in the gclus package.\n\nThe Burt data set probably has a typo in the original correlation\nmatrix. Changing the Sorrow- Tenderness correlation from .87 to .81\nmakes the correlation positive definite.\n\nAs pointed out by Jan DeLeeuw, the Burt data set is a subset of 8\nvariables from the original 11 reported by Burt in 1915. That matrix has\nthe same problem. See `burt`.\n\nOther example data sets that are useful demonstrations of factor\nanalysis are the seven bifactor examples in `Bechtoldt` and the 24\nability measures in `Harman74.cor`\n\nThere are several other Harman examples in the psych package (i.e.,\nHarman.8) as well as in the dataseta and GPArotation packages. The\nHarman 24 mental tests problem is in the basic datasets package at\nHarman74.cor.\n\nOther Harman data sets are 5 socioeconomic variables for 12 census\ntracts Harman.5 used by John Loehlin as an example for EFA. Another one\nof the many Harman (1967) data sets is Harman.political. This contains 8\npolitical variables taken over 147 election areas. The principal factor\nmethod with SMCs as communalities match those of table 8.18. The data\nare used by Dziubian and Shirkey as an example of the Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin\ntest of factor adequacy.\n\n### Source\n\nHarman (1967 p 164 and p 244.)\n\nH. Harman and W.Jones.

(defn psych-Holzinger "  ----------- -----------------\n  Bechtoldt     Documentation\n  ----------- -----------------\n\n## Seven data sets showing a bifactor solution.\n\n### Description\n\nHolzinger-Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model of a general\nfactor and uncorrelated group factors. The Holzinger data sets are\noriginal 14 \\* 14 matrix from their paper as well as a 9 \\*9 matrix used\nas an example by Joreskog. The Thurstone correlation matrix is a 9 \\* 9\nmatrix of correlations of ability items. The Reise data set is 16 \\* 16\ncorrelation matrix of mental health items. The Bechtholdt data sets are\nboth 17 x 17 correlation matrices of ability tests.\n\n\n\n### Details\n\nHolzinger and Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model (one\ngeneral factor and several group factors) for mental abilities. This is\na nice demonstration data set of a hierarchical factor structure that\ncan be analyzed using the `omega` function or using sem. The bifactor\nmodel is typically used in measures of cognitive ability.\n\nThere are several ways to analyze such data. One is to use the `omega`\nfunction to do a hierarchical factoring using the Schmid-Leiman\ntransformation. This can then be done as an exploratory and then as a\nconfirmatory model using `omegaSem`. Another way is to do a regular\nfactor analysis and use either a `bifactor` or `biquartimin` rotation.\nThese latter two functions implement the Jennrich and Bentler (2011)\nbifactor and biquartimin transformations. The `bifactor` rotation\nsuffers from the problem of local minima (Mansolf and Reise, 2016) and\nthus a mixture of exploratory and confirmatory analysis might be\npreferred.\n\nThe 14 variables are ordered to reflect 3 spatial tests, 3 mental speed\ntests, 4 motor speed tests, and 4 verbal tests. The sample size is 355.\n\nAnother data set from Holzinger (Holzinger.9) represents 9 cognitive\nabilities (Holzinger, 1939) and is used as an example by Karl Joreskog\n(2003) for factor analysis by the MINRES algorithm and also appears in\nthe LISREL manual as example NPV.KM. This data set represents the scores\nfrom the Grant White middle school for 9 tests: \\\"t01_visperc\\\"\n\\\"t02_cubes\\\" \\\"t04_lozenges\\\" \\\"t06_paracomp\\\" \\\"t07_sentcomp\\\"\n\\\"t09_wordmean\\\" \\\"t10_addition\\\" \\\"t12_countdot\\\" and \\\"t13_sccaps\\\"\nand as variables x1 \\... x9 (for the Grant-White school) in the lavaan\npackage.\n\nAnother classic data set is the 9 variable Thurstone problem which is\ndiscussed in detail by R. P. McDonald (1985, 1999) and and is used as\nexample in the sem package as well as in the PROC CALIS manual for SAS.\nThese nine tests were grouped by Thurstone and Thurstone, 1941 (based on\nother data) into three factors: Verbal Comprehension, Word Fluency, and\nReasoning. The original data came from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941)\nbut were reanalyzed by Bechthold (1961) who broke the data set into two.\nMcDonald, in turn, selected these nine variables from the larger set of\n17 found in Bechtoldt.2. The sample size is 213.\n\nAnother set of 9 cognitive variables attributed to Thurstone (1933) is\nthe data set of 4,175 male students reported by Carl Brigham of\nPrinceton to the College Entrance Examination Board. (Brigham, 1932,\nTable VIII p 352.) This set does not show a clear bifactor solution but\nis included as a demonstration of the differences between a maximimum\nlikelihood factor analysis solution versus a principal axis factor\nsolution. On page 352, we are given reliability estimates of .86, .73,\n.83, .97,.94, .85, .92, .92, and .90. These are based upon sampling 743\nboys.\n\nA parallel set (also from Brigham) is the correlation matrix of the same\n9 variables for 2899 girls. (Thurstone.33G)\n\nTucker (1958) uses 9 variables from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941) for\nhis example of `interbattery` factor analysis.\n\nMore recent applications of the bifactor model are to the measurement of\npsychological status. The Reise data set is a correlation matrix based\nupon \\>35,000 observations to the Consumer Assessment of Health Care\nProvideers and Systems survey instrument. Reise, Morizot, and Hays\n(2007) describe a bifactor solution based upon 1,000 cases.\n\nThe five factors from Reise et al. reflect Getting care quickly (1-3),\nDoctor communicates well (4-7), Courteous and helpful staff (8,9),\nGetting needed care (10-13), and Health plan customer service (14-16).\n\nThe two Bechtoldt data sets are two samples from Thurstone and Thurstone\n(1941). They include 17 variables, 9 of which were used by McDonald to\nform the Thurstone data set. The sample sizes are 212 and 213\nrespectively. The six proposed factors reflect memory, verbal, words,\nspace, number and reasoning with three markers for all expect the rote\nmemory factor. 9 variables from this set appear in the Thurstone data\nset.\n\nTwo more data sets with similar structures are found in the `Harman`\ndata set. This includes the another 9 variables (with 696 subjects) from\nHolzinger used by Harman `link{Harman.Holzinger}` as well as 8 affective\nvariables from `link{burt}`.\n\nAnother data set that is worth examining for tests of bifactor structure\nis the holzinger.swineford data set which includes the original data\nfrom Holzinger and Swineford (1939) supplied by Keith Widaman. This is\nin the psychTools package.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.1: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 212.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.2: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213.\n\n-   Holzinger: 14 x 14 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 355\n\n-   Holzinger.9: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 145\n\n-   Reise: 16 x 16 correlation matrix of health satisfaction items. N =\n    35,000\n\n-   Thurstone: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213\n\n-   Thurstone.33: Another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests,\n    N=4175\n\n-   Thurstone:9: And yet another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability\n    tests, N =710\n\n### Note\n\nNote that these are tests, not items. Thus, it was possible to find the\nreliabilities of each test.\n\nFor the Holzinger 14 tests these were found from 1- t2 where t = c(.332,\n.517, .360, .382, .354,.249, .444, .393, .455, .424, .393, .487, .534,\n.382) (page 53) and thus the reliabilities were 0.890, 0.733, 0.870,\n0.854, 0.875, 0.938, 0.803, 0.846, 0.793, 0.820, 0.846, 0.763, 0.715,\n0.854.\n\nFor the Holzinger.9 tests, the reliabilities for the Grant-White tests\nwere: .76, .57, .94, .65, .75, .87, .95, .84 and .89 (Keith Widaman,\npersonal communication, 2020),\n\n### Source\n\nHolzinger: Holzinger and Swineford (1937)\\\nReise: Steve Reise (personal communication)\\\nsem help page (for Thurstone) Brigham (for Thurstone.33)\n\n### References\n\nBechtoldt, Harold, (1961).

(defn psych-Reise "  ----------- -----------------\n  Bechtoldt     Documentation\n  ----------- -----------------\n\n## Seven data sets showing a bifactor solution.\n\n### Description\n\nHolzinger-Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model of a general\nfactor and uncorrelated group factors. The Holzinger data sets are\noriginal 14 \\* 14 matrix from their paper as well as a 9 \\*9 matrix used\nas an example by Joreskog. The Thurstone correlation matrix is a 9 \\* 9\nmatrix of correlations of ability items. The Reise data set is 16 \\* 16\ncorrelation matrix of mental health items. The Bechtholdt data sets are\nboth 17 x 17 correlation matrices of ability tests.\n\n\n\n### Details\n\nHolzinger and Swineford (1937) introduced the bifactor model (one\ngeneral factor and several group factors) for mental abilities. This is\na nice demonstration data set of a hierarchical factor structure that\ncan be analyzed using the `omega` function or using sem. The bifactor\nmodel is typically used in measures of cognitive ability.\n\nThere are several ways to analyze such data. One is to use the `omega`\nfunction to do a hierarchical factoring using the Schmid-Leiman\ntransformation. This can then be done as an exploratory and then as a\nconfirmatory model using `omegaSem`. Another way is to do a regular\nfactor analysis and use either a `bifactor` or `biquartimin` rotation.\nThese latter two functions implement the Jennrich and Bentler (2011)\nbifactor and biquartimin transformations. The `bifactor` rotation\nsuffers from the problem of local minima (Mansolf and Reise, 2016) and\nthus a mixture of exploratory and confirmatory analysis might be\npreferred.\n\nThe 14 variables are ordered to reflect 3 spatial tests, 3 mental speed\ntests, 4 motor speed tests, and 4 verbal tests. The sample size is 355.\n\nAnother data set from Holzinger (Holzinger.9) represents 9 cognitive\nabilities (Holzinger, 1939) and is used as an example by Karl Joreskog\n(2003) for factor analysis by the MINRES algorithm and also appears in\nthe LISREL manual as example NPV.KM. This data set represents the scores\nfrom the Grant White middle school for 9 tests: \\\"t01_visperc\\\"\n\\\"t02_cubes\\\" \\\"t04_lozenges\\\" \\\"t06_paracomp\\\" \\\"t07_sentcomp\\\"\n\\\"t09_wordmean\\\" \\\"t10_addition\\\" \\\"t12_countdot\\\" and \\\"t13_sccaps\\\"\nand as variables x1 \\... x9 (for the Grant-White school) in the lavaan\npackage.\n\nAnother classic data set is the 9 variable Thurstone problem which is\ndiscussed in detail by R. P. McDonald (1985, 1999) and and is used as\nexample in the sem package as well as in the PROC CALIS manual for SAS.\nThese nine tests were grouped by Thurstone and Thurstone, 1941 (based on\nother data) into three factors: Verbal Comprehension, Word Fluency, and\nReasoning. The original data came from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941)\nbut were reanalyzed by Bechthold (1961) who broke the data set into two.\nMcDonald, in turn, selected these nine variables from the larger set of\n17 found in Bechtoldt.2. The sample size is 213.\n\nAnother set of 9 cognitive variables attributed to Thurstone (1933) is\nthe data set of 4,175 male students reported by Carl Brigham of\nPrinceton to the College Entrance Examination Board. (Brigham, 1932,\nTable VIII p 352.) This set does not show a clear bifactor solution but\nis included as a demonstration of the differences between a maximimum\nlikelihood factor analysis solution versus a principal axis factor\nsolution. On page 352, we are given reliability estimates of .86, .73,\n.83, .97,.94, .85, .92, .92, and .90. These are based upon sampling 743\nboys.\n\nA parallel set (also from Brigham) is the correlation matrix of the same\n9 variables for 2899 girls. (Thurstone.33G)\n\nTucker (1958) uses 9 variables from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941) for\nhis example of `interbattery` factor analysis.\n\nMore recent applications of the bifactor model are to the measurement of\npsychological status. The Reise data set is a correlation matrix based\nupon \\>35,000 observations to the Consumer Assessment of Health Care\nProvideers and Systems survey instrument. Reise, Morizot, and Hays\n(2007) describe a bifactor solution based upon 1,000 cases.\n\nThe five factors from Reise et al. reflect Getting care quickly (1-3),\nDoctor communicates well (4-7), Courteous and helpful staff (8,9),\nGetting needed care (10-13), and Health plan customer service (14-16).\n\nThe two Bechtoldt data sets are two samples from Thurstone and Thurstone\n(1941). They include 17 variables, 9 of which were used by McDonald to\nform the Thurstone data set. The sample sizes are 212 and 213\nrespectively. The six proposed factors reflect memory, verbal, words,\nspace, number and reasoning with three markers for all expect the rote\nmemory factor. 9 variables from this set appear in the Thurstone data\nset.\n\nTwo more data sets with similar structures are found in the `Harman`\ndata set. This includes the another 9 variables (with 696 subjects) from\nHolzinger used by Harman `link{Harman.Holzinger}` as well as 8 affective\nvariables from `link{burt}`.\n\nAnother data set that is worth examining for tests of bifactor structure\nis the holzinger.swineford data set which includes the original data\nfrom Holzinger and Swineford (1939) supplied by Keith Widaman. This is\nin the psychTools package.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.1: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 212.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.2: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213.\n\n-   Holzinger: 14 x 14 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 355\n\n-   Holzinger.9: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 145\n\n-   Reise: 16 x 16 correlation matrix of health satisfaction items. N =\n    35,000\n\n-   Thurstone: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213\n\n-   Thurstone.33: Another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests,\n    N=4175\n\n-   Thurstone:9: And yet another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability\n    tests, N =710\n\n### Note\n\nNote that these are tests, not items. Thus, it was possible to find the\nreliabilities of each test.\n\nFor the Holzinger 14 tests these were found from 1- t2 where t = c(.332,\n.517, .360, .382, .354,.249, .444, .393, .455, .424, .393, .487, .534,\n.382) (page 53) and thus the reliabilities were 0.890, 0.733, 0.870,\n0.854, 0.875, 0.938, 0.803, 0.846, 0.793, 0.820, 0.846, 0.763, 0.715,\n0.854.\n\nFor the Holzinger.9 tests, the reliabilities for the Grant-White tests\nwere: .76, .57, .94, .65, .75, .87, .95, .84 and .89 (Keith Widaman,\npersonal communication, 2020),\n\n### Source\n\nHolzinger: Holzinger and Swineford (1937)\\\nReise: Steve Reise (personal communication)\\\nsem help page (for Thurstone) Brigham (for Thurstone.33)\n\n### References\n\nBechtoldt, Harold, (1961).

One is to use the `omega`\nfunction to do a hierarchical factoring using the Schmid-Leiman\ntransformation. This can then be done as an exploratory and then as a\nconfirmatory model using `omegaSem`. Another way is to do a regular\nfactor analysis and use either a `bifactor` or `biquartimin` rotation.\nThese latter two functions implement the Jennrich and Bentler (2011)\nbifactor and biquartimin transformations. The `bifactor` rotation\nsuffers from the problem of local minima (Mansolf and Reise, 2016) and\nthus a mixture of exploratory and confirmatory analysis might be\npreferred.\n\nThe 14 variables are ordered to reflect 3 spatial tests, 3 mental speed\ntests, 4 motor speed tests, and 4 verbal tests. The sample size is 355.\n\nAnother data set from Holzinger (Holzinger.9) represents 9 cognitive\nabilities (Holzinger, 1939) and is used as an example by Karl Joreskog\n(2003) for factor analysis by the MINRES algorithm and also appears in\nthe LISREL manual as example NPV.KM. This data set represents the scores\nfrom the Grant White middle school for 9 tests: \\\"t01_visperc\\\"\n\\\"t02_cubes\\\" \\\"t04_lozenges\\\" \\\"t06_paracomp\\\" \\\"t07_sentcomp\\\"\n\\\"t09_wordmean\\\" \\\"t10_addition\\\" \\\"t12_countdot\\\" and \\\"t13_sccaps\\\"\nand as variables x1 \\... x9 (for the Grant-White school) in the lavaan\npackage.\n\nAnother classic data set is the 9 variable Thurstone problem which is\ndiscussed in detail by R. P. McDonald (1985, 1999) and and is used as\nexample in the sem package as well as in the PROC CALIS manual for SAS.\nThese nine tests were grouped by Thurstone and Thurstone, 1941 (based on\nother data) into three factors: Verbal Comprehension, Word Fluency, and\nReasoning. The original data came from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941)\nbut were reanalyzed by Bechthold (1961) who broke the data set into two.\nMcDonald, in turn, selected these nine variables from the larger set of\n17 found in Bechtoldt.2. The sample size is 213.\n\nAnother set of 9 cognitive variables attributed to Thurstone (1933) is\nthe data set of 4,175 male students reported by Carl Brigham of\nPrinceton to the College Entrance Examination Board. (Brigham, 1932,\nTable VIII p 352.) This set does not show a clear bifactor solution but\nis included as a demonstration of the differences between a maximimum\nlikelihood factor analysis solution versus a principal axis factor\nsolution. On page 352, we are given reliability estimates of .86, .73,\n.83, .97,.94, .85, .92, .92, and .90. These are based upon sampling 743\nboys.\n\nA parallel set (also from Brigham) is the correlation matrix of the same\n9 variables for 2899 girls. (Thurstone.33G)\n\nTucker (1958) uses 9 variables from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941) for\nhis example of `interbattery` factor analysis.\n\nMore recent applications of the bifactor model are to the measurement of\npsychological status. The Reise data set is a correlation matrix based\nupon \\>35,000 observations to the Consumer Assessment of Health Care\nProvideers and Systems survey instrument. Reise, Morizot, and Hays\n(2007) describe a bifactor solution based upon 1,000 cases.\n\nThe five factors from Reise et al. reflect Getting care quickly (1-3),\nDoctor communicates well (4-7), Courteous and helpful staff (8,9),\nGetting needed care (10-13), and Health plan customer service (14-16).\n\nThe two Bechtoldt data sets are two samples from Thurstone and Thurstone\n(1941). They include 17 variables, 9 of which were used by McDonald to\nform the Thurstone data set. The sample sizes are 212 and 213\nrespectively. The six proposed factors reflect memory, verbal, words,\nspace, number and reasoning with three markers for all expect the rote\nmemory factor. 9 variables from this set appear in the Thurstone data\nset.\n\nTwo more data sets with similar structures are found in the `Harman`\ndata set. This includes the another 9 variables (with 696 subjects) from\nHolzinger used by Harman `link{Harman.Holzinger}` as well as 8 affective\nvariables from `link{burt}`.\n\nAnother data set that is worth examining for tests of bifactor structure\nis the holzinger.swineford data set which includes the original data\nfrom Holzinger and Swineford (1939) supplied by Keith Widaman. This is\nin the psychTools package.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.1: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 212.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.2: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213.\n\n-   Holzinger: 14 x 14 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 355\n\n-   Holzinger.9: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 145\n\n-   Reise: 16 x 16 correlation matrix of health satisfaction items.

This is\na nice demonstration data set of a hierarchical factor structure that\ncan be analyzed using the `omega` function or using sem. The bifactor\nmodel is typically used in measures of cognitive ability.\n\nThere are several ways to analyze such data. One is to use the `omega`\nfunction to do a hierarchical factoring using the Schmid-Leiman\ntransformation. This can then be done as an exploratory and then as a\nconfirmatory model using `omegaSem`. Another way is to do a regular\nfactor analysis and use either a `bifactor` or `biquartimin` rotation.\nThese latter two functions implement the Jennrich and Bentler (2011)\nbifactor and biquartimin transformations. The `bifactor` rotation\nsuffers from the problem of local minima (Mansolf and Reise, 2016) and\nthus a mixture of exploratory and confirmatory analysis might be\npreferred.\n\nThe 14 variables are ordered to reflect 3 spatial tests, 3 mental speed\ntests, 4 motor speed tests, and 4 verbal tests. The sample size is 355.\n\nAnother data set from Holzinger (Holzinger.9) represents 9 cognitive\nabilities (Holzinger, 1939) and is used as an example by Karl Joreskog\n(2003) for factor analysis by the MINRES algorithm and also appears in\nthe LISREL manual as example NPV.KM. This data set represents the scores\nfrom the Grant White middle school for 9 tests: \\\"t01_visperc\\\"\n\\\"t02_cubes\\\" \\\"t04_lozenges\\\" \\\"t06_paracomp\\\" \\\"t07_sentcomp\\\"\n\\\"t09_wordmean\\\" \\\"t10_addition\\\" \\\"t12_countdot\\\" and \\\"t13_sccaps\\\"\nand as variables x1 \\... x9 (for the Grant-White school) in the lavaan\npackage.\n\nAnother classic data set is the 9 variable Thurstone problem which is\ndiscussed in detail by R. P. McDonald (1985, 1999) and and is used as\nexample in the sem package as well as in the PROC CALIS manual for SAS.\nThese nine tests were grouped by Thurstone and Thurstone, 1941 (based on\nother data) into three factors: Verbal Comprehension, Word Fluency, and\nReasoning. The original data came from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941)\nbut were reanalyzed by Bechthold (1961) who broke the data set into two.\nMcDonald, in turn, selected these nine variables from the larger set of\n17 found in Bechtoldt.2. The sample size is 213.\n\nAnother set of 9 cognitive variables attributed to Thurstone (1933) is\nthe data set of 4,175 male students reported by Carl Brigham of\nPrinceton to the College Entrance Examination Board. (Brigham, 1932,\nTable VIII p 352.) This set does not show a clear bifactor solution but\nis included as a demonstration of the differences between a maximimum\nlikelihood factor analysis solution versus a principal axis factor\nsolution. On page 352, we are given reliability estimates of .86, .73,\n.83, .97,.94, .85, .92, .92, and .90. These are based upon sampling 743\nboys.\n\nA parallel set (also from Brigham) is the correlation matrix of the same\n9 variables for 2899 girls. (Thurstone.33G)\n\nTucker (1958) uses 9 variables from Thurstone and Thurstone (1941) for\nhis example of `interbattery` factor analysis.\n\nMore recent applications of the bifactor model are to the measurement of\npsychological status. The Reise data set is a correlation matrix based\nupon \\>35,000 observations to the Consumer Assessment of Health Care\nProvideers and Systems survey instrument. Reise, Morizot, and Hays\n(2007) describe a bifactor solution based upon 1,000 cases.\n\nThe five factors from Reise et al. reflect Getting care quickly (1-3),\nDoctor communicates well (4-7), Courteous and helpful staff (8,9),\nGetting needed care (10-13), and Health plan customer service (14-16).\n\nThe two Bechtoldt data sets are two samples from Thurstone and Thurstone\n(1941). They include 17 variables, 9 of which were used by McDonald to\nform the Thurstone data set. The sample sizes are 212 and 213\nrespectively. The six proposed factors reflect memory, verbal, words,\nspace, number and reasoning with three markers for all expect the rote\nmemory factor. 9 variables from this set appear in the Thurstone data\nset.\n\nTwo more data sets with similar structures are found in the `Harman`\ndata set. This includes the another 9 variables (with 696 subjects) from\nHolzinger used by Harman `link{Harman.Holzinger}` as well as 8 affective\nvariables from `link{burt}`.\n\nAnother data set that is worth examining for tests of bifactor structure\nis the holzinger.swineford data set which includes the original data\nfrom Holzinger and Swineford (1939) supplied by Keith Widaman. This is\nin the psychTools package.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.1: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 212.\n\n-   Bechtoldt.2: 17 x 17 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213.\n\n-   Holzinger: 14 x 14 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 355\n\n-   Holzinger.9: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 145\n\n-   Reise: 16 x 16 correlation matrix of health satisfaction items. N =\n    35,000\n\n-   Thurstone: 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests, N = 213\n\n-   Thurstone.33: Another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability tests,\n    N=4175\n\n-   Thurstone:9: And yet another 9 x 9 correlation matrix of ability\n    tests, N =710\n\n### Note\n\nNote that these are tests, not items. Thus, it was possible to find the\nreliabilities of each test.\n\nFor the Holzinger 14 tests these were found from 1- t2 where t = c(.332,\n.517, .360, .382, .354,.249, .444, .393, .455, .424, .393, .487, .534,\n.382) (page 53) and thus the reliabilities were 0.890, 0.733, 0.870,\n0.854, 0.875, 0.938, 0.803, 0.846, 0.793, 0.820, 0.846, 0.763, 0.715,\n0.854.\n\nFor the Holzinger.9 tests, the reliabilities for the Grant-White tests\nwere: .76, .57, .94, .65, .75, .87, .95, .84 and .89 (Keith Widaman,\npersonal communication, 2020),\n\n### Source\n\nHolzinger: Holzinger and Swineford (1937)\\\nReise: Steve Reise (personal communication)\\\nsem help page (for Thurstone) Brigham (for Thurstone.33)\n\n### References\n\nBechtoldt, Harold, (1961).

Subsample for the replication of columns 1--5 from Table 4\n    in Aghion et al. (2013).\n\n### Details\n\nAghion et al. (2013) combine several firm level panel datasets (e.g.,\nUSPTO, SEC and Compustat) to examine the role of institutional investors\nin the governance of innovation. Their baseline to model innovation is\nthe Poisson model, but they also consider negative binomial models.\nBerger et al. (2017) argue that nonlinearities in the innovation process\nemerge in case that the first innovation is especially hard to obtain in\ncomparison to succeeding innovations. Then, hurdle models offer a useful\nway that allows for a distinction between these two processes. Berger et\nal. (2017) show that an extended analysis with negative binomial hurdle\nmodels differs materially from the outcomes of the single-equation\nPoisson approach of Aghion et al. (2013).\n\nInstitutional ownership (institutions) is defined as the proportion of\nstock owney by institutions. According to Aghion et al. (2013), an\ninstitutional owner is defined as an institution that files a Form 13-F\nwith the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nFuture cite-weighted patents (cites) are used as a proxy for innovation.\nThey are calculated using ultimately granted patent, dated by year of\napplication, and weight these by future citations through 2002 (see\nAghion et al. (2013)).\n\nThe presample average of cite-weighted patents (precites) is used by\nAghion et al. (2013) as a proxy for unobserved heterogeneity, employing\nthe \\\"presample mean scaling\\\" method of Blundell et al. (1999).\n\nThe inverse Lerner index in the firm\\'s three-digit industry is used as\na time-varying measure for product market competition (competition),\nwhere the Lerner is calculated as the median gross margin from the\nentire Compustat database in the firm\\'s three-digit industry (see\nAghion et al. (2013)). A time-invariant measure for competition\n(acompetition) is constructed by averaging the Lerner over the sample\nperiod.\n\nThe classification of institutions into \\\"quasiindexed\\\", \\\"transient\\\"\nand \\\"dedicated\\\" follows Bushee (1998) and distinguishes between\ninstitutional investors based on their type of investing. Quasiindexed\ninstitutions are do not trade much and are widely diversified, dedicated\ninstitution do not trade much and have more concentrated holdings, and\ntransient institutions often trade and have diversified holdings (see\nAghion et al. (2013) and Bushee (1998)).\n\n### Source\n\nData and online appendix of Aghion et al.

The result of that\nexperiment was that, in fact, ascorbate did seem to prolong the lives of\nthese patients. But then a second question arose. Was the effect of the\nascorbate different when different organs were affected by the cancer?\nThe researchers took a second look at the data. This time they\nconcentrated only on those patients who received the ascorbate and\ndivided the data up by which organ was affected by the cancer. They had\n5 different organs represented among the patients (all of whom only had\none organ affected): Stomach, bronchus, colon, ovary, and breast.\n\n### Source\n\nFrom the article \\\"Supplemental Ascorbate in the Supportive Treatment of\nCancer: Reevaluation of Prolongation of Survival Times in Terminal Human\nCancer\\\" by Ewan Cameron and Linus Pauling, Proceedings of the National\nAcademy of Sciences of the United States of America, Vol. 75, No. 9\n(Sep., 1978), pp. 4538-4542.\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/Stat2Data/CancerSurvival.csv"))

Milgram\\'s subjects were asked to monitor the answers\nof a \\\"learner\\\" and to push a button to deliver shocks whenever the\nlearner gave a wrong answer. The more wrong answers, the more powerful\nthe shock. Even Milgram himself was surprised by the results: Every one\nof his subjects ended up delivering what they thought was a dangerous\n300-volt shock to a slow \\\"learner\\\" as punishment for repeated wrong\nanswers.\\\n\nEven though the \\\"shocks\\\" were not real and the \\\"learner\\\" was in on\nthe secret, the results triggered a hot debate about ethics and\nexperiments with human subjects. To study attitudes on this issue,\nHarvard graduate student Maryann de Mateo conducted a randomized\ncomparative experiment. Her subjects were 37 high school teachers who\ndid not know about the Milgram study. Using chance, Maryann assigned\neach teacher to one of three treatment groups:\\\n\nGroup 1: Actual results. Each subject in this group read a description\nof Milgram\\'s study, including the actual results that every subject\ndelivered the highest possible \\\"shock.\\\"\\\n\nGroup 2: Many complied. Each subject read the same description given to\nthe subjects in Group 1, except that the actual results were replaced by\nfake results, that many but not all subjects complied.\\\n\nGroup 3. Most refused. For subjects in this group, the fake results said\nthat most subjects refused to comply.\\\n\nAfter reading the description, each subject was asked to rate the study\naccording to how ethical they thought it was, from 1 (not at all\nethical) to 9 (completely ethical.)\n\n### Source\n\n\\\"An experimental study of attitudes toward deception\\\" by Mary Ann\nDiMatteo.

This datafile gives\ninformation about the amount of sea ice in the arctic region as measured\nin September (the time when the amount of ice is at its least) since\n1979. The basic research question is to see if we can use time to model\nthe amount of sea ice.\n\nIn fact, there are two ways to measure the amount of sea ice: Area and\nExtent. Area measures the actual amount of space taken up by ice. Extent\nmeasures the area inside the outer boundaries created by the ice. If\nthere are areas inside the outer boundaries that are not ice (think\nabout a slice of swiss cheese), then the Extent will be a larger number\nthan the Area. In fact, this is almost always true.\n\n### Source\n\nData from\nftp://sidads.colorado.edu/DATASETS/NOAA/G02135/Sep/N_09_areaV2.txt\nupdated data from\n\nWitt, G.

The larvae from these sea slugs need to locate this\ntype of seaweed to survive. A study was done to try to determine whether\nchemicals that leach out of the seaweed attract the larvae. Seawater was\ncollected over a patch of this kind of seaweed at 5-minute intervals as\nthe tide was coming in and, presumably, mixing with the chemicals. The\nidea was that as more seawater came in, the concentration of the\nchemicals was reduced. Each sample of water was divided into 6 parts.\nFifteen larvae were then introduced to this seawater to see what\npercentage metamorphosed (an indication that the desired chemical was\ndetected).\n\n### Source\n\nData downloaded from\nhttp://www.stat.ucla.edu/projects/datasets/seaslug-explanation.html\n\n### References\n\nA paper based on these data: Krug, P.J. and R.K.

These data offer a partial replication of\nJackman (1978).\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA data frame with the following 11 variables.\n\n`iso3c`\n\n:   a three-character ISO code for state identification\n\n`country`\n\n:   an English country name\n\n`jci`\n\n:   Jackman\\'s (1978) coup index from 1960 to 1975\n\n`tmis`\n\n:   Johnson et al.\\'s (1984) total military involvement score\n\n`agperc`\n\n:   an estimate of the percentage of the country\\'s labor force in\n    agriculture and animal husbandry\n\n`indperc`\n\n:   an estimate of the percentage of the country\\'s labor force in\n    industry\n\n`literacy_cnts`\n\n:   an estimate of countrywide literacy from around 1965\n\n`literacy_ba`\n\n:   another estimate of countrywide literacy from around 1965\n\n`leperc`\n\n:   an estimate of the size of the largest ethnic group, as a percentage\n\n`partydom`\n\n:   the percentage of the vote received by the largest party in the\n    country prior to independence\n\n`turnout`\n\n:   the turnout (as a percentage) at the independence referendum\n\n### Details\n\nData exist for instructional purposes, especially about modeling\ninteractions. Reading Jackman (1978) and Johnson et al. (1984) will\nprovide more information about the data and hypotheses. There was a\nfollow-up symposium on this in 1986 in *American Political Science\nReview* that may be an interesting read and provide even more context\nabout what\\'s at stake in this debate.\n\nEnglish country names are country names from around the time of\npublication. Take note of older names of \\\"Dahomey\\\", \\\"Swaziland\\\",\n\\\"Upper Volta\\\", and \\\"Zaire.\\\" The three-character ISO codes are\ncurrent, mostly for ease of doing other things with the data. However,\nthis comes with the acknowledgment that Dahomey and Zaire used to have\ndifferent ISO codes under their older names. Both codes for Dahomey\n(`DHY`) and Zaire (`ZAR`) were retired in 1977 and 1997, respectively.\n\nIdeally, I\\'d have Morrison\\'s (1972) *Black Africa*, but I do not. I\nhave a copy of a 1989 update, though. That\\'s what I consulted in\nconstructing this data set.\n\nJackman (1978) is deceptively opaque on what he\\'s doing for the ethnic\ngroup variable and arguably misleads on what his turnout variable is\nactually from. In the case of the ethnic group variable, it\\'s the\ndifference between saying the largest ethnic group in Rwanda is 98% of\nthe population versus 80% of the population. In short, it\\'s the\ndifference of saying whether there are any Tutsi at all in the country.\nBasically, I\\'m uncertain with what he\\'s doing with what Morrison et\nal. (1989) define as \\\"ethnic clusters\\\".\n\nMercifully, the coup variables come from a replication by Johnson et al.\n(1984). Based on Morrison et al.\\'s (1989) updated data, it\\'s not clear\nhow Jackman could\\'ve derived some of these estimates using the formula\nhe said he used. For example, Benin should have a score of 39 based on\nthe information in Table 2.10 (p. 373 in Morrison et al. (1989)).\nCameroon should have a 1 and not a 2, per Table 5.10 (p. 399). My\ncomments here work under the assumption that Morrison et al. are adding\ninformation and not revising information in the second edition of the\n*Black Africa* handbook.\n\nTo be more precise, both the Jackman coup index and total military\ninvolvement variables are directly copied from Table 2 in Johnson et al.\n(1984) on p. 627. Missingness in the Jackman coup index variable\ncommunicates the country was not included in his original study, but was\nincluded in the Johnson et al. replication.\n\nRelated: the agricultural variable is a midway point between columns B\nand columns C in Table 3.11 of Morrison et al. (1989). I do not think\nthis is too far removed from what Jackman was looking at in an older\nversion of the same data, but there will be slight differences. It\\'s\nthe difference of \\\"these variables came from 1966\\\" versus \\\"this is an\nimputation of 1960 to 1970\\\". The latter is what I offer here. I can\nonly do so much here.\n\nTo continue this theme of the opacity in trying to reconstruct the data,\nit seems Jackman (1978, p. 1265) misleads the reader a bit in saying\nthat the social mobilization index incorporates the percentage of the\nlabor force that is not employed in agriculture. He seems to have meant\nthat he\\'s using the percentage of the labor force that is employed in\nindustry. Otherwise, the summary statistics he reports could not be\nreproduced or reasonably approximated by way of Morrison et al. (1989).\nThis industry percentage variable comes from Table 3.14 in Morrison et\nal. (1989) and is likewise a midway point between 1960 and 1970.\n\nThe literacy variables have suffices communicating where I obtained\nthem. The Cross-National Time Series Database has a variable effectively\ncommunicating this information that I was using first in trying to\nrecreate these data. These data come from 1965 in that data set. Jackman\nand Johnson et al. are assuredly using Morrison\\'s almanac. That\ninformation is in Table 4.11 of Morrison et al. (1989), though it\\'s\npossible the estimates contained therein are slightly different than\nwhat was reported in the first edition. I cannot know for sure.\n\nEthiopia is conspicuously missing in the party dominance variable.\nThat\\'s by design, and apparently its omission warranted ample\ndiscussion both by Jackman (1978) and Johnson et al. (1984). Johnson et\nal. (1984, fns. 4,5) argue it\\'s a curious choice that can situationally\ninfluence the results that Jackman reports, but there are also lots of\nother choices made by Jackman (1978) that can influence these results.\n\nI am 99.9% sure the turnout variable is Table 5.9 in Morrison et al.\n(1989). Jackman (1978) says this is from *before* independence but I\\'m\nconfident he meant it was the turnout at the independence referendum.\n\n### References\n\nJackman, Robert W. 1978. \\\"The Predictability of Coups d\\'etat: A Model\nwith African Data.\\\" *American Political Science Review* 72(4): 1262-75.\n\nJackman, Robert W., Rosemary H.

Do you want\nto guess which one?\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA data frame with 49 observations on the following 5 variables.\n\n`year`\n\n:   the year\n\n`nkill`\n\n:   a numeric vector for the number killed in acts of terrorism\n\n`terrtotal`\n\n:   a numeric vector for the number killed or wounded in acts of\n    terrorism\n\n`suicides`\n\n:   a numeric vector for the number of suicides\n\n`ddfat`\n\n:   a numeric vector for the number of drunk-driving fatalities\n\n### Details\n\nFollowing my own work in *Political Research Quarterly*, terror\nincidents with unknown fatalities or number wounded were imputed to\nbe 1. In those cases, the GTD has reason to believe at least one person\ndied or was wounded, but doesn\\'t know how many. GTD is weird about\n1993, so perhaps treat those observations with some care (though it does\nwell to capture the WTC bombing that year). Suicides include only those\nwho passed, not those who survived a suicide attempt. Drunk-driving\nfatalities seem to include those who were killed in a drunk-driving\naccident despite not being drunk themselves.\n\n### Source\n\nGlobal Terrorism Database (Sept. 2019 update), Centers for Disease\nControl, U.S. Department of Transportation\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/stevedata/DST.csv"))

This creates an interval-ish measure with a nice and mostly\n    normal distribution.\n\n`sumnatsoc`\n\n:   a numeric vector for the sum of all responses toward various\n    \\\"social\\\" prompts (i.e. `natenvir`, `natheal`, `natdrug`,\n    `nateduc`, `natrace`, `natfare`, `natroad`, `natmass`, `natpark`,\n    `natsoc`, `natchld`). This creates an interval-ish measure with a\n    mostly normal (but small left skew) distribution.\n\n### Details\n\nFor all the variables beginning with `nat`, note that I rescaled the\noriginal data so that -1 = respondent thinks country is spending too\nmuch on this topic, 0 = respondent thinks country is spending \\\"about\n(the) right\\\" amount, and 1 = respondent thinks country is spending too\nlittle on this topic. I do this to facilitate reading each `nat` prompt\nas increasing support for more spending (the extent to which increasing\nvalues means the respondent thinks the country spends too little on a\ngiven prompt). I think this is more intuitive.\n\nAlso, the `natspac`, `natenvir`, `natheal`, `natcity`, `natcrime`,\n`natdrug`, `nateduc`, `natrace`, `natarms`, `nataid`, and `natfare` have\n\\\"alternate\\\" prompts in later GSS waves in which a subset of\nrespondents get a slightly different prompt. For example, one set of\nrespondents for `natcity` gets a prompt of \\\"Solving the problems of the\nbig cities\\\" (the legacy prompt) whereas another set of respondents gets\na prompt of \\\"Assistance to big cities\\\" (typically noted as \\\"version\ny\\\" in the GSS). I, perhaps problematically if I were interested in\npublishing analyses on these data, combine both prompts into a single\nvariable. I don\\'t think it\\'s a huge problem for what I want the data\nto do, but FYI.\n\n### Source\n\nGeneral Social Survey, 2018\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/stevedata/gss_spending.csv"))

The \\\"Quick\nUDS\\\" estimates are generated to be latent and, globally, have a mean\nthat approximates 0 and a standard deviation that approximates 1. In the\nregression context, that would mean a coefficient would communicate\nsomething like a magnitude change across a standard deviation on the\nscale. The \\\"polyarchy\\\" estimate has a theoretical minimum of 0 and a\ntheoretical maximum of 1. In the regression context, that would mean a\ncoefficient communicates a min/max effect. The Polity project estimate\ncomes from a usual scale of -10 to 10 and a regression coefficient\ncommunicates something much less exotic.

Spain and Portugal appear at the start of the panel, though\nthe transition to democracy for both wouldn\\'t start until 1974/1975.\nThe data also have some obvious COVID weirdness for 2020.

You can extract\nthis information into multiple columns with a `separate` function from\nthe [tidyr]{.pkg} package. This is mostly for convenience. Be mindful of\ntwo things: First, dates are dates of first and last action, and not\nnecessarily the escalation to war, per se. Second, dates can be\n\\\"missing\\\". These are -9s, and are commonplace when archival research\ncan\\'t pinpoint an exact day something happened.\n\nObservations select at the *confrontation*-level where maximum\nfatalities are greater than 1,000 and at the *participant*-level where\n(1) the participant engaged in at least an attack during this\nconfrontation, (2) there are no instances where a participant dropped\nin/out on the same side of a multilateral confrontation or switched\nsides, and (3) the confrontation doesn\\'t have an instance where a\nparticipant incurred fatalities while themselves not initiating a use of\nforce. For illustration\\'s sake, the Taiwan Straits Crises saw several\nappearances by the United States, but only one instance (for six days in\nFeb. 1953) where the U.S. engaged in an attack. World War II is a\nclassic case of participants switching sides (France did so three\ntimes), but it also happened in the War of Latvian Independence as well\n(MIC#2604). The War of Attrition also saw the Russians reappear twice.\nCases like these aren\\'t included, mostly for convenience sake. In\ntotal, 41 cases with 1,000 maximum fatalities or more at the\nconfrontation-level are excluded because of this. Of these 41 cases,\nWorld War II and the Vietnam War are the most conspicuous by their\nabsence. Data come from version 1.01 of the Militarized Interstate\nConfrontation data.\n\nOpponent fatalities are strictly dyadic and are derived from the\nMilitarized Interstate Events data.\n\nCapabilities, GDP, and democracy data come from [peacesciencer]{.pkg}\nfor a forthcoming v. 1.2.0 release. See package for more information,\nthough references are also included below. Variables are mostly lagged\nto the year prior to the participant observation year. However, there\nare several cases in the data that are born into war (see: India,\nPakistan, North and South Korea, North and South Vietnam). In cases of\nmissing data, information from the observation year is used.\n\nThe `tpop` and `wbpopest` columns are measuring the same thing but are\nderived from two different data sets with two different data-generating\nprocedures. Use whichever one you like, but be mindful of what you\\'re\ndoing and for what purpose you\\'re doing it.\n\n### References\n\nAnders, Therese, Christopher J. Fariss, and Jonathan N.

In 2010 Dr. Angela Dispenzieri and colleagues assayed FLC\nlevels on those samples from the original study for which they had\npatient permission and from which sufficient material remained for\nfurther testing. They found that elevated FLC levels were indeed\nassociated with higher death rates.\n\nPatients were recruited when they came to the clinic for other\nappointments, with a final random sample of those who had not yet had a\nvisit since the study began. An interesting side question is whether\nthere are differences between early, mid, and late recruits.\n\nThis data set contains an age and sex stratified random sample that\nincludes 7874 of the original 15759 subjects.

Progression is slow\nbut inexhortable, eventually leading to cirrhosis and liver\ndecompensation. The condition has been recognised since at least 1851\nand was named \\\"primary biliary cirrhosis\\\" in 1949. Because cirrhosis\nis a feature only of advanced disease, a change of its name to \\\"primary\nbiliary cholangitis\\\" was proposed by patient advocacy groups in 2014.\n\nThis data is from the Mayo Clinic trial in PBC conducted between 1974\nand 1984. A total of 424 PBC patients, referred to Mayo Clinic during\nthat ten-year interval, met eligibility criteria for the randomized\nplacebo controlled trial of the drug D-penicillamine. The first 312\ncases in the data set participated in the randomized trial and contain\nlargely complete data. The additional 112 cases did not participate in\nthe clinical trial, but consented to have basic measurements recorded\nand to be followed for survival. Six of those cases were lost to\nfollow-up shortly after diagnosis, so the data here are on an additional\n106 cases as well as the 312 randomized participants.\n\nA nearly identical data set found in appendix D of Fleming and\nHarrington; this version has fewer missing values.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\n  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------------\n  age:        in years\n  albumin:    serum albumin (g/dl)\n  alk.phos:   alkaline phosphotase (U/liter)\n  ascites:    presence of ascites\n  ast:        aspartate aminotransferase, once called SGOT (U/ml)\n  bili:       serum bilirunbin (mg/dl)\n  chol:       serum cholesterol (mg/dl)\n  copper:     urine copper (ug/day)\n  edema:      0 no edema, 0.5 untreated or successfully treated\n              1 edema despite diuretic therapy\n  hepato:     presence of hepatomegaly or enlarged liver\n  id:         case number\n  platelet:   platelet count\n  protime:    standardised blood clotting time\n  sex:        m/f\n  spiders:    blood vessel malformations in the skin\n  stage:      histologic stage of disease (needs biopsy)\n  status:     status at endpoint, 0/1/2 for censored, transplant, dead\n  time:       number of days between registration and the earlier of death,\n              transplantion, or study analysis in July, 1986\n  trt:        1/2/NA for D-penicillmain, placebo, not randomised\n  trig:       triglycerides (mg/dl)\n              \n  ----------- ---------------------------------------------------------------\n\n### Source\n\nT Therneau and P Grambsch (2000), *Modeling Survival Data: Extending the\nCox Model*, Springer-Verlag, New York.

It also\ncontains further follow-up.\n\nOne feature of the data deserves special comment. The last observation\nbefore death or liver transplant often has many more missing covariates\nthan other data rows. The original clinical protocol for these patients\nspecified visits at 6 months, 1 year, and annually thereafter. At these\nprotocol visits lab values were obtained for a pre-specified battery of\ntests. \\\"Extra\\\" visits, often undertaken because of worsening medical\ncondition, did not necessarily have all this lab work.

This excess DNA thickens the mucus, which then\ncannot be cleared from the lung by the cilia. The accumulation leads to\nexacerbations of respiratory symptoms and progressive deterioration of\nlung function. At the time of this study more than 90% of cystic\nfibrosis patients eventually died of lung disease.\n\nDeoxyribonuclease I (DNase I) is a human enzyme normally present in the\nmucus of human lungs that digests extracellular DNA. Genentech, Inc.\ncloned a highly purified recombinant DNase I (rhDNase or Pulmozyme)\nwhich when delivered to the lungs in an aerosolized form cuts\nextracellular DNA, reducing the viscoelasticity of airway secretions and\nimproving clearance. In 1992 the company conducted a randomized\ndouble-blind trial comparing rhDNase to placebo. Patients were then\nmonitored for pulmonary exacerbations, along with measures of lung\nvolume and flow. The primary endpoint was the time until first pulmonary\nexacerbation; however, data on all exacerbations were collected for 169\ndays.\n\nThe definition of an exacerbation was an infection that required the use\nof intravenous (IV) antibiotics. Subjects had 0--5 such episodes during\nthe trial, those with more than one have multiple rows in the data set,\nthose with none have NA for the IV start and end times. A few subjects\nwere infected at the time of enrollment, subject 173 for instance has a\nfirst infection interval of -21 to 7. We do not count this first\ninfection as an \\\"event\\\", and the subject first enters the risk set at\nday 7. Subjects who have an event are not considered to be at risk for\nanother event during the course of antibiotics, nor for an additional 6\ndays after they end. (If the symptoms reappear immediately after\ncessation then from a medical standpoint this would not be a new\ninfection.)\n\nThis data set reproduces the data in Therneau and Grambsch, it does not\nexactly reproduce those in Therneau and Hamilton due to data set\nupdates.\n\n### References\n\nT.

The Rotterdam data is used to create a fitted model,\nand the GBSG data for validation of the model. The paper gives\nreferences for the data source.\n\nThere are 43 subjects who have died without recurrence, but whose death\ntime is greater than the censoring time for recurrence. A common way\nthat this happens is that a death date is updated in the health record\nsometime after the research study ended, and said value is then picked\nup when a study data set is created. Vital status information can come\nfrom many sources: a patient visit for another condition,\ncorrespondence, financial transactions, or social media. But this raises\nserious questions about censoring. For instance subject 40 is censored\nfor recurrence at 4.2 years and died at 6.6 years; when creating the\nendpoint of recurrence free survival (earlier of recurrence or death),\ntreating them as a death at 6.6 years implicitly assumes that they were\nrecurrence free just before death. For this to be true we would have to\nassume that if they had progressed in the 2.4 year interval before death\n(while off study), that this information would also have been noted in\ntheir general medical record, and would also be captured in the study\ndata set. However, that may be unlikely. Death information is often in a\ncentralized location in electronic health records, easily accessed by a\nprogrammer and merged with the study data, while recurrence may require\nmanual review. How best to address this is an open issue.\n\n### References\n\nPatrick Royston and Douglas Altman, External validation of a Cox\nprognostic model: principles and methods.

The number of liver transplants rises\nover the period, but the number of subjects added to the liver\ntransplant waiting list grew much faster. Important questions addressed\nby the data are the change in waiting time, who waits, and whether there\nwas an consequent increase in deaths while on the list.\n\nBlood type is an important consideration. Donor livers from subjects\nwith blood type O can be used by patients with A, B, AB or 0 blood\ntypes, whereas an AB liver can only be used by an AB recipient. Thus\ntype O subjects on the waiting list are at a disadvantage, since the\npool of competitors is larger for type O donor livers.\n\nThis data is of historical interest and provides a useful example of\ncompeting risks, but it has little relevance to current practice. Liver\nallocation policies have evolved and now depend directly on each\nindividual patient\\'s risk and need, assessments of which are regularly\nupdated while a patient is on the waiting list. The overall organ\nshortage remains acute, however.\n\nThe `transplant` data set was a version used early in the analysis,\n`transplant2` has several additions and corrections, and was the final\ndata set and matches the paper.\n\n### References\n\nKim WR, Therneau TM, Benson JT, Kremers WK, Rosen CB, Gores GJ, Dickson\nER.

One possibility is\nto test whether putting the single marriage rating variable, ratemarr,\nis enough, against the alternative that a full set of dummy variables is\nneeded; see pages 239-240 for a similar example.

In other words, the\nfamily head was presented with prices for the eco-labeled and regular\napples, and then asked how much of each kind of apple the family would\nbuy at the given prices. As predicted by basic economics, the own price\neffect is negative (and strong) and the cross price effect is positive\n(and strong). While the main dependent variable, ecolbs, piles up at\nzero, estimating a linear model is still worthwhile. Interestingly,\nbecause the survey design induces a strong positive correlation between\nthe prices of eco-labeled and regular apples, there is an omitted\nvariable problem if either of the price variables is dropped from the\ndemand equation. A good exam question is to show a simple regression of\necolbs on ecoprc and then a multiple regression on both prices, and ask\nstudents to decide whether the price variables must be positively or\nnegatively correlated.\n\nUsed in Text: pages 201, 223, 266, 626-627\n\n### Source\n\n<https://www.cengage.com/cgi-wadsworth/course_products_wp.pl?fid=M20b&product_isbn_issn=9781111531041>\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/wooldridge/apple.csv"))

Presumably these factors\nenter into the publication index. It is hard to think we want to hold\nthe main factors driving productivity fixed when trying to measure the\neffect of productivity on salary. Pooled OLS regression with \"cluster\nrobust\" standard errors seems more natural. On the other hand, if we\nwant to measure the return to having a degree from a top 20 Ph.D.\nprogram then we would want to control for factors that cause selection\ninto a top 20 program. Unfortunately, this variable does not change over\ntime, and so FD and FE are not applicable.\n\nUsed in Text: not used\n\n### Source\n\n<https://www.cengage.com/cgi-wadsworth/course_products_wp.pl?fid=M20b&product_isbn_issn=9781111531041>\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/wooldridge/big9salary.csv"))

There, it\nis shown that the instrumental variable, 'nearc4\\', is actually\ncorrelated with \\'IQ\\', at least for the subset of men for which an IQ\nscore is reported. However, the correlation between \\'nearc4\" and\n\\'IQ\\', once the other explanatory variables are netted out, is arguably\nzero. At least, it is not statistically different from zero. In other\nwords, \\'nearc4\\' fails the exogeneity requirement in a simple\nregression model but it passes, at least using the crude test described\nabove, if controls are added to the wage equation. For a more advanced\ncourse, a nice extension of Card's analysis is to allow the return to\neducation to differ by race. A relatively simple extension is to include\nblack education (blackeduc) as an additional explanatory variable; its\nnatural instrument is blacknearc4.\n\nUsed in Text: pages 526-527, 547\n\n### Source\n\n<https://www.cengage.com/cgi-wadsworth/course_products_wp.pl?fid=M20b&product_isbn_issn=9781111531041>\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/wooldridge/card.csv"))

Another\npossibility is to use this data set for a problem set in Chapter 4,\nafter students have read Example 4.10. That example, which uses teacher\nsalary/benefit data at the school level, finds the expected tradeoff,\nalthough it appears to less than one-to-one. By contrast, if you do a\nsimilar analysis with FRINGE.RAW, you will not find a tradeoff. A\npositive coefficient on the benefit/salary ratio is not too surprising\nbecause we probably cannot control for enough factors, especially when\nlooking across different occupations. The Michigan school-level data is\nmore aggregated than one would like, but it does restrict attention to a\nmore homogeneous group: high school teachers in Michigan.\n\nUsed in Text: page 624-625\n\n### Source\n\n<https://www.cengage.com/cgi-wadsworth/course_products_wp.pl?fid=M20b&product_isbn_issn=9781111531041>\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/wooldridge/fringe.csv"))

A simple and\ninteresting question is whether, once the previous year's post-season\nRPI is controlled for, does the pre-season RPI -- which is supposed to\nadd information on recruiting and player development -- help to predict\nperformance (such as win percentage or making it to the NCAA men's\nbasketball tournament). For the binary outcome that indicates making it\nto the NCAA tournament, a probit or logit model can be used for courses\nthat introduce more advanced methods.

The demand equation would have ltothsg as a function of lrent,\nlavginc, and lpop. The supply equation would have ltothsg as a function\nof lrent, pctst, and lpop. Thus, in estimating the demand function,\npctstu is used as an IV for lrent. Clearly one can quibble with\nexcluding pctstu from the demand equation, but the estimated demand\nfunction gives a negative price effect. Getting information for 2000,\nand adding many more college towns, would make for a much better\nanalysis. Information on number of spaces in on-campus dormitories would\nbe a big improvement, too.\n\nUsed in Text: pages 160, 477, 503-504\n\n### Source\n\n<https://www.cengage.com/cgi-wadsworth/course_products_wp.pl?fid=M20b&product_isbn_issn=9781111531041>\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/wooldridge/rental.csv"))

Professor Rouse\nkindly provided the original data set from her paper. Data loads lazily.\n\n\n\n### Format\n\nA data.frame with 990 observations on 19 variables:\n\n-   **studyid:** student identifier\n\n-   **black:** = 1 if African-American\n\n-   **hispanic:** = 1 if Hispanic\n\n-   **female:** = 1 if female\n\n-   **appyear:** year of first application: 90 to 93\n\n-   **mnce:** math NCE test score, 1994\n\n-   **select:** = 1 if ever selected to attend choice school\n\n-   **choice:** = 1 if attending choice school, 1994\n\n-   **selectyrs:** years selected to attend choice school\n\n-   **choiceyrs:** years attended choice school\n\n-   **mnce90:** mnce in 1990\n\n-   **selectyrs1:** = 1 if selectyrs == 1\n\n-   **selectyrs2:** = 1 if selectyrs == 2\n\n-   **selectyrs3:** = 1 if selectyrs == 3\n\n-   **selectyrs4:** = 1 if selectyrs == 4\n\n-   **choiceyrs1:** = 1 if choiceyrs == 1\n\n-   **choiceyrs2:** = 1 if choiceyrs == 2\n\n-   **choiceyrs3:** = 1 if choiceyrs == 3\n\n-   **choiceyrs4:** = 1 if choiceyrs == 4\n\n### Notes\n\nThis is a condensed version of the data set used by Professor Rouse. The\noriginal data set had missing information on many variables, including\npost-policy and pre-policy test scores. I did not impute any missing\ndata and have dropped observations that were unusable without filling in\nmissing data. There are 990 students in the current data set but\npre-policy test scores are available for only 328 of them. This is a\ngood example of where eligibility for a program is randomized but\nparticipation need not be. In addition, even if we look at just the\neffect of eligibility (captured in the variable selectyrs) on the math\ntest score (mnce), we need to confront the fact that attrition (students\nleaving the district) can bias the results. Controlling for the\npre-policy test score, mnce90, can help -- but at the cost of losing\ntwo-thirds of the observations. A simple regression of mnce on selectyrs\nfollowed by a multiple regression that adds mnce90 as a control is\ninformative. The selectyrs dummy variables can be used as instrumental\nvariables for the choiceyrs variable to try to estimate the effect of\nactually participating in the program (rather than estimating the so-\ncalled intention-to-treat effect). Computer Exercise C15.11 steps\nthrough the details.\n\nUsed in Text: pages 550-551\n\n### Source\n\n<https://www.cengage.com/cgi-wadsworth/course_products_wp.pl?fid=M20b&product_isbn_issn=9781111531041>\n" [] (fetch-dataset "https://vincentarelbundock.github.io/Rdatasets/csv/wooldridge/voucher.csv"))
